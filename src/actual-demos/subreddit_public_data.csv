https://www.reddit.com/user/WeOutHereIndoors,t2_56dw3dql,I miss university,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1j804lm/i_miss_university/,"Been out of school for 7 years now, time is a bitch. Have a good job, good social life and a great girlfriend. All in all my life is good. 

Waterloo wasn‚Äôt always the best environment for a social life to thrive. People were competitive, some in a super dickhead kind of way, and everyone was always studying. I hope the campus now is more social and inviting than when I was a student. 

But man, I just miss when my biggest stress was passing an exam. I miss hanging out with my friends all night and just laughing. I miss going out multiple nights a week. I miss seeing my friends EVERYDAY. I know a lot of people in this group worry about co-ops, and their grades and all that stuff which is important. But these are gonna be some great years of your life, some of the best if you want them to. Go out more, put yourself out there, say yes instead of no, study LESS.


Looking back now, I never wished that I studied more, worked harder, or even tried harder. I wish that I went out more, stayed out later, stayed up longer because that‚Äôs what you remember. I look back at my Snapchat memories and smile, just wish that I had more of them. You remember the moments, not whether or not you passed ur fucking exam (granted the all nighters study sessions with the homies were always hilarious). 

If you‚Äôre still in school, make the most of it. Grades are important but you‚Äôll never be 18-22 with your friends again. There will come a time where the people you see everyday, you see maybe once a month. The friends you have now won‚Äôt be the friends you have later, the love won‚Äôt be lost, life just gets in the way. 

To my former and current Warriors, have some fucking fun.

https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted],,Hero at Waterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1jh3t62/hero_at_waterloo/,"I never thought I would ever get reddit just for this day, but here we are. I just wanted to first off say thank you to the asian guy that saved our lives a few days ago. Out of respect to his parent's wishes after talking with them, I won't be saying his name out in public like this, but hopefully one day he might see this and know how thankful we are for someone like him. Me and my friends all owe our lives to this guy. While playing badminton in the gym at Guelph, a large piece of metal accidentally fell from the top floor and we were frozen in fear.

The guy jumped in front collided with the bar and even now I can still hear the sound of the impact even now. It sucks because like I feel so lucky, yet so sad and like I can't even sleep thinking about how he is doing and like why did it have to be just him taking the hit and not all of us collectively. We all feel terrible for what happened to him and when we heard about his condition we rushed to see him at the hospital to offer our thanks and apologies.

When we arrived at the hospital it was too late and he entered into this unconscious comatose-like state and the doctor told us he is likely to have permanent nerve damage and impairment to his memory and personality. The worst part is I keep imaging different worlds in how maybe just maybe we could have helped him if we reacted faster or maybe we could have all just tried dodging the beam instead of standing like idiots, but now we think that he might never wake up and know what a difference he has made in our lives.

Even after the incident, he walked it off before we could talk to him and the only thing he said to us was ""I'm going home"" and later on fell unconscious when he arrived home. We never got to know this guy and yet he jumped in the face of death for no reason and no offense I have been a Guelph girlie and always thought men at Waterloo are just creeps, but he honestly made a difference in my perspective and I don't think any amount of apologies can fix what he is currently going through.

We left gifts at the hospital for him, if he ever recovers to see them. He is a true hero at the core of his heart and if you ever see this just know that we pray that you get well soon. Your friends and loved ones are lucky to have you and we all wish the best üíú.

The Khalistan movement in the 1980s and 1990s became associated with violence, terrorism, and militancy. Support for the movement in public universities could inadvertently promote extremism or embolden those advocating violent methods to achieve political goals. Universities should be places where peaceful dialogue and critical thought are encouraged, rather than platforms for potentially violent separatist movements. Promoting the movement could fuel tensions among students, disrupt campus life, and possibly even incite conflict or hatred, especially in diverse multicultural settings.

While academic freedom is crucial, universities have a responsibility to ensure that political activism does not cross the line into supporting or advocating for agendas that promote division, violence, or hatred. Endorsing the Khalistan movement could blur the line between academic inquiry and political partisanship. Universities should focus on fostering objective study and debate around important political issues, without becoming venues.

I'm super excited to share that after months of plotting in my crusty V1 basement, I've finally rolled out my long-awaited revenge on the WaterlooWorks interface. I can't even begin to describe the amount of hatred that went into this... I basically destroyed every pixel placement on the platform, and carefully designed it in a way such that it maximized confusion. 

Before the project, I did a LOT of malicious research, analyzed how to create the most frustrating user experience possible, and even consulted Laurier CS majors for their expertise on crafting unusable web interfaces. I also ignored students from each faculty and dismissed detailed feedback on pain points and navigation, all in the hopes of sabotaging the job application workflow.

I was responsible for removing the shortlisting feature on WaterlooWorks, as I realized that it was helping people succeed where I had failed. So, I introduced a much more convoluted way to organize job applications - job folders! This catastrophic change will let you lose track of your applications completely, welcome to the nightmare of job hunting. And I also took part in breaking the search and filter system, so now it's actually unusable.

Just in case any of you regards who YOLO'd your life savings into Nikola back in 2020 thought you were getting some of your money back...nope.

Notable quote from the big man himself:

&gt;‚ÄúI am free. The prosecutors can no longer hurt me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt destroy my family, they can‚Äôt rip everything away from me, they can‚Äôt ruin my life.‚Äù

So nice that Trev can no longer have his life ruined. Too fucking bad for the hundreds, if not thousands of shareholders who he scammed with his truck-rolling-down-the-hill fiasco.

This was not due to a direct order from Playstack (A Playstack representative told me this) but from a interpretation of a message about enforcing the rules of the subreddit.



Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds. The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic. We have removed this moderator from the moderation team.



We will not be allowing AI generated images on this subreddit from now on. We will make sure our rules and FAQ reflect this soon",balatro,1741573435,t3_1j7ocoa,,20417,0.93,False,0,757,,376093

I think we need to be the mature people here, which we are, and make sure we let the left know their ideas are welcome here to debate in the conservative movement. The admins here have done a fantastic job with the debate threads for example. 

We need to figure out a way how to unify again as a country...even though I disagree with the left on many things Im tired of this anger. I dont wanna have pointless fights for the sake of fighting with my fellow countrymen anymore, its exhausting.  I want a country where we can disagree but understand that we all want the best.",Conservative,1742003822,t3_1jbkixw,Flaired Users Only,8268,0.92,False,0,3690,,1244436

They are official documents bearing the signature of the President.

He was President when they were signed and issued.  If someone else forged his signature, it was, and still is, up to him to state that.  If he makes no such claim, then he accepts them as his own orders.

&gt;But he was senile

He was the president.  He still had all the powers of the president.  The 25th amendment provides a mechanism for removing those powers should he become incapable of executing his duties.  If he was senile, it was up to Harris and the cabinet to act.  Or for Congress to impeach him.",Conservative,1742734528,t3_1jhymlw,Flaired Users Only,8111,0.86,False,0,879,,1244436

Every little thing Trump says or doesn't say will somehow lead to World War 3, the collapse of the dollar and the collapse of America and only democrats, yes those same dems that just got their asses handed to them, can save us!

Someone posted a blue ""Is he dead yet"" hat on some sub, and countless weirdos were quite excited about it, and we all know what they were talking about.  Most of us were not fans of Biden/Harris or the dems, but we don't want anyone to die.  We just wanted to beat them at the polls.  Apparently, that's not how many democrats feel about our side.

It seems that the left have lost their collective minds, particularly so here on Reddit.

P.S. Today is the day that butthurt leftists are boycotting Amazon, so if you need anything from AMZN, it's a good day to shop there, imo.

Jumping into the chats of other teams' and players' streams and **spreading toxicity** there is and **will not be tolerated**. We will be reaching out to the mods of LR's opponents during each scrims block and we will be sharing lists of chatters who decide to go there and spread negativity, hate or any toxicity. Doing so will lead to **instant and permanent bans** in Caedrel's chat and the chats of the other LR boys as well. 

The majority of our community has been nothing but supportive and appreciation posts about not just LR but even enemy teams have been popping up on the subreddit and we are very grateful for that. Sadly, with a community this large (and growing every day), there will be toxic and annoying rats who think that somehow putting down the opposition makes LR look better - in fact, it does the exact opposite.

We want to help build a community that spreads positivity and we will do our best to do so. If any of you spot a chatter that you suspect from drama baiting or spreading toxicity and negativity, please feel free to reach out to our mods on Twitch and let them know.
