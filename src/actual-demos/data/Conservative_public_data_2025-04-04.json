We arent going to become a unified country and actually achieve the goal of being a true America unless we figure out how to get the left out of their crazy bullshit. \n\nI dont wanna go through life hating the people I disagree with politically. We have different ideas but the point of this country is we hash out ideas and let the best ideas win but we will not be  able to achieve that in this current state. \n\nI think we need to be the mature people here, which we are, and make sure we let the left know their ideas are welcome here to debate in the conservative movement. The admins here have done a fantastic job with the debate threads for example. \n\nWe need to figure out a way how to unify again as a country...even though I disagree with the left on many things Im tired of this anger. I dont wanna have pointless fights for the sake of fighting with my fellow countrymen anymore, its exhausting.  I want a country where we can disagree but understand that we all want the best.",

            "body": "I read the posts on various Reddit subs, and it seems to me that much/most of Reddit has gone batshit crazy.  Every little thing Trump says or doesn't say will somehow lead to World War 3, the collapse of the dollar and the collapse of America and only democrats, yes those same dems that just got their asses handed to them, can save us!\n\nSomeone posted a blue \"Is he dead yet\" hat on some sub, and countless weirdos were quite excited about it, and we all know what they were talking about.  Most of us were not fans of Biden/Harris or the dems, but we don't want anyone to die.  We just wanted to beat them at the polls.  Apparently, that's not how many democrats feel about our side.\n\nIt seems that the left have lost their collective minds, particularly so here on Reddit.\n\nP.S. Today is the day that butthurt leftists are boycotting Amazon, so if you need anything from AMZN, it's a good day to shop there, imo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggews7m4icne1.jpg?width=1011&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f555295abe87fcc6cc67c34a851cdbd6d3ff4eec",
