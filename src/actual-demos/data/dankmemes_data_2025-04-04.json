Every time they cite something, too, they give almost no info, they say like \"a poll showed that 90 percent of people approve of what Trump is doing\" instead of \"A Pew research poll conducted in 2016 showed that 90 percent of self-identified conservatives either approve, or mostly approve of Trump's policies\" which is more what I'm used to.",

I wouldn't be surprised if it was just that so many sitting politicians were on the list that they deem it a national security risk for the sake of preventing a widespread revolt against the government as a whole.",

I think it's common knowledge that for him language is just a tool, and that's his supporters care about the story around what he does, rather than the truth of what he actually does. There's literally nothing that he can't spin to his supporters, so it literally doesn't matter what he does.\n\nNow, why Biden didn't release them, that's a good question, and I hope someone can elaborate. Who knows, maybe there actually are foreign heads of state there that we don't want to ruin relationships with? (At least Biden didn't)",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 \u2060Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n\n\u2022 \u2060Spreading incorrect information,\n\n\u2022 \u2060Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\nI don\u2019t believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

The physical disc **required** you to sign-in to to Steam in order to launch the game. I had an activation code as well that I needed to enter, which just added insult to injury. \n\nI didn't have Internet at that time, which is why I opted for the physical copy of a single player game. That is the moment I was radicalized against all forms of DRM. \n\nYou are right though, what DRM Valve uses isn't bad like others. It stops lazy piracy and is good enough for that, unlike other DRM which is the cause of performance issues in AAA titles.",

If there are billboards/signs/video boards in an environment, I think it even makes sense from a world-building perspective. I've never understood why they shoehorn sponsorships into Madden (like the Snickers\u2122 halftime report) when they could just fill the stadiums with real ads. Same thing with NFS or Burnout or Battlefield, like why not use those billboards to advertise real products?\n\nBut as soon as I see an ad video or a banner ad in a game, I'm out. The ads they already have in games where they try to sell you microtransactions are bad enough as it is.",

Sponsors on a replica of a real life race car? Fine! Banners of racing brands on the side of the road? Questionable, but probably fine as long as there is playable ingame content of these brands. Some completely unrelated brand on a banner on the side of the road? Not fine!",

And i loved crashing into Gillette vans in Burnout Paradise lol\n\nI mean, where are we even starting to define something as an \"advertisement\" anyways?  \nFor example, licensed cars in racing games could be seen as a form of advertising as well. Or real-life brands for car parts like in NFS:U2. And what about logos on player's clothes in sports games? If you stretch it far enough, even the league logos (like Bundesliga in soccer games) are some kind of advertising, as they display an external brand within a game.  \nYet these are all things probably no player ever cared about.\n\nI'm absolutely not for ads in games. Fuck video ads, fuck any form of immersion-breaking ads. We surely all agree we don't want a Monster energy billboard in Skyrim, as someone made as an example below. But IMO showing brands within games is absolutely fine if they not only do not break the immersion, but actually add to it, like in my examples.  \n\nI'm kind of split into which category billboards go, though. They can add to the immersion, but if the game is full of fake brands and then has like 3 RL brands pushed into your face it is breaking the immersion. So this is by far not a topic that we should see as \"ads good/ads bad\" only, there's a lot of shades to it. No ads of any kind would make some games awful, even. \n\n(Sorry to have hijacked your short comment for a ramble that went longer the longer I thought about it, lol)",

I also tried to set up a sub for doing local mutual aid but wasn't allowed to bc I don't have enough karma, but there is no publicly available karma threshold so how am i supposed to know when I've got enough? This app is starting to suck more by the day. Shoulda got out when they put ads in the comments. I'm downloading lemmy rn, hopefully it gets big enough to compete, and reddit can just be another rightwing echo chamber like facebook or twitter. These tech bros haven't found an app they cant ruin.",

Reddit praised this, because social media was suppressing information to benefit *their* side.\n\nNow that the white house has changed parties, social media is once more bending the knees to their masters, censoring discussions that people like the average redditor actually *want*. Tell me reddit, how do those leopards feel on your face?",

Workers may only be there every few days, or at one point during the day, but they will experiment with different coning strategies if it's a major artery, and they will leave them up ahead of time and in between work happening.\n\nI think about how terrifying it can be just to walk along a highway, or some roads, and then having to work there. I'm all for anything that increases their safety. Sometimes I do think that it seems like it would be worth it to apply more of the transportation budget to certain projects if it meant getting them done more quickly. It seems like it would save money in the long run in some cases, especially for society as a whole with crashes, injuries, traffic causing work slow downs, etc.",

So the reason that an exit that may not be actively constructed gets blocked during a closure is traditionally for access of equipment purposes. For instance, when concrete paving, the concrete, once batched, is now on a timer and needs to be placed within the time limit or it will not set properly. Therefore, you need to have a route that ensures the trucks do not get delayed and can cycle efficiently to ensure you can complete your work within the closure time.",

Essentially the number of lanes, speed of traffic and duration of closure factor into this and will either extend or shorten the length of the closure. So even if you are only performing work in a 300' stretch, you need to have a full closure that extends several hundred feet on either side to allow for ingress and egress of work vehicles. Then on top of that say 1000' you will need to have a mile long taper to close a lane with an additional mile of signage to advise drivers of the upcoming closure.",

They're already keeping anything they don't actually spend from the original bid, that's how construction bidding works lol. Early finish dates or partial finish incentives have been a thing for literal decades and they're known from the RFP stage of the project and companies are bidding projects with those incentives already in mind.\n\nWherever the fuck you live wasn't running out time and material projects for every job lmao. \n\nYou know the best way to make money in construction? Finish a project on budget and on time, not trying to nickel and dime your way into the green at the end of the project through change orders making the state never want to work with you again.",

Delivinging that bypass, or train line up during *your* term as opposed to a time blow-out and potentially giving a free gift to your opposition if they win the next election plays more of a factor than you'd think.\n\nI've had to deal with 3 seperate state significant construction projects just this month and I can tell you right now timing and public perception (which is partially why everything needs years of public display, community consultation, and years of press releases about how environmentally friendly the project is) are much bigger factors than cost.\n\nIf you check my posting history it's no secret that I'm an elected official for a small city, and a major part of the gig is juggling the practical issues that arise from these projects whilst keeping state and federal members (and their personal agendas) happy.\n\nBut hey, as you are willing to teach a class from continents away the floor is yours to explain how things work.",

I put in a complaint and it was immediately closed with a note saying someone had been out and crews were working. I checked the complaint map and dozens of the same complaint, all closed shortly after opening with the same BS comment. \n\nAbout a year ago they started to actually work on it. They finished it about 6 months ago and then just left the comes up, still blocking traffic and even shutting it down going west. They\u2019re just now finishing painting it, but they\u2019ve completely fucked up the traffic flow by taking out a lane to put in 4 parking spots.",

Shunting all traffic over to one side, one lane, for at least 15 miles. \n\nThe northbound side was closed for nearly five years. The southbound side was then closed for a similar amount of time. If you were lucky, you might have seen a grand total of three construction workers during the entire drive. Equipment would sit in the same exact spot for months at a time. \n\nFinally, when it fully reopened, it was worse than when they had started. I still don't know what they were doing, or trying to do there. Rough patchwork that probably covered over what were once minor cracks led to either a bumpy or swervy ride. These patches quickly turned to massive potholes as soon as a plow thought about going anywhere near it in the winter. I have since moved away, but when I go to visit my family back there, it's still bad.",

Yes, healthcare here is free, but that doesn't mean every kid has a free therapist on speed dial. The only two ways a kid would get professional help would be if they were either actually mentally challenged or they got institutionalized for trying to harm themselves or other kids in some major way. You don't get preventive help just for being a weirdo loner. The difference here is that the weirdo loner doesn't have an easy access to a gun.",

See, the mental healthcare issue is ironically enough spurred on by the school shooting crisis; adding ice to the mix just makes things worse. However, just as there really isn't a good guy with a gun nor bad guy with a gun,  there are responsible gun owners, and irresponsible gun owners,  a responsible gun owner actively has a locked gun safe with a key only they, their partner, and their kids (once they become of age which varies in household from 15 to never depending on maturity). This is where guns should be stored in any situation, usually in the closet of the master bedroom or anywhere close to the parents.  It is done this way in case of a home intruder.  This was how I was brought up, albeit I was also introduced to firearms and their dangers at a young age.  However, not everyone are my parents, and like with most people in the world, people are irresponsible.  The irresponsible gun owner more than likely has a gun safe that is always unlocked (if they even own one), keep their guns put in the open or in touch of any kind of person who could get their hands on them, or actively plays with them as if they were a toy.  Which is where disturbing events usually take place.  Most of which end with injury or worse.  Which happens more often than you think.  Negligent  discharge of fire arms is a common thing in most of the world and usually people don't think when it happens or the fire arm is pointed in a direction it really shouldn't be when it does.  I wish there was a way to explain to people why practicing firearm safety not only in the field but at home is important. And why ensuring firearms are stored properly is important not just for your safety but also for the safety of others.",

Do the ICE agents have to have something like a provable cause or they just enter whatever they need? Have there being any cases of them causing unnecessary stress to students/religious people by entering such building for no reason? \n\nSeems to me that if someone is a criminal, it shouldn\u2019t matter if they are in a religious building or not for them to be arrested. Illegal immigration is a serious crime pretty much everywhere. (edit: \"serious crime\" is a bit of an overstatement on my part. Here I mean that it's more serious than, let's say, shoplifting, and I specifically mean the illegal entry, not something like a visa overstay)",

I didn't quite mean that it's the same as assault or murder, but it's more serious than, let's say, shoplifting or something minor like that. Another part of this consideration is the person illegally coming to the country. If it's just a guy who wants to work and who fled their (presumably) war-torn country, it's one thing, if it's a violent criminal who was released from another country - it's another matter. Which is why the issue is quite complex from what I understand. \n\n&gt; How can you imagine them NOT causing stress by just their mere official presence?\n\nThe mere presence itself is irrelevant. I specifically asked whether there were cases where the presence was without a warrant or even a provable cause of some kind (i.e. \"for no reason\") that caused such stress *unnecessarily*. \n\nIf the arrest is legitimate, it doesn't matter where it took place. Otherwise criminals will just hide in churches and schools, making it more dangerous for the people in these buildings in the first place.",

Hell COD didn't even bother to hide their AI garbage and prople still shell out cash for that hypermilked franchise.  \nIt has nothing to do witb \"production costs\" and everything with how much companies think they can get away with.",

That is not the case because the US sites list only 1 price, which mean the price increase for physical might be exclusive to some region in Europe.",

[According to the US govt's inflation calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm), cumulative inflation puts that at equivalent of $78 today.  Rough guesstimate from current trends, it'll be the equivalent of $80 at some point this summer.\n\nThat's how brutal inflation over the past five years has been--imagine you put $60 aside for the release, and suddenly you're $20 short.\n\nNow imagine you had $600,000 saved for retirement, enough to sustain you for your entire retirement when augmented with social security, and suddenly you're $200,000 short.",

Just keeping up with inflation, that would mean AAA games should cost around 90 dollars now, if there was zero price increase in real terms.\n\nDevelopers have actually managed to keep games cheaper than in the past. Working backwards, a 75 dollar game today would cost 51.50 in 2010.\n\nHonestly, I want to encourage devs to make good games and to quit the bullshit with battle passes and dlc. If they go back to the model of old where you just get a full, great, finished game on release, I'm more than happy to pay 80-90 bucks for it. You can't get mad when devs make shitty games when you won't pay them to make good ones.",

The prices of literally everything have gone up, not just video games.\n\nOn the other hand, where I\u2019m at the minimum wage went up from $7 to $20. The ratio of how much you\u2019re making to how much you\u2019re spending is probably about the same as it was 10 years ago.",

The amount of hours you can get of entertainment from a video game is just about limitless. even most \"cheap\" (especially any that include art, interactive media, or technology in general) hobbies cost so much more for such little entertainment. Things are going to get way more expensive and I'm surprised it's not already doubled since the fucking 90s. Y'all keep wanting cheap games without subscriptions or non-cosmetic micro transactions but don't want to pay for the massive infrastructure that it takes to make them. Crazy.",

She was wearing a long skirt. Some guy snuck up behind her and lifted her skirt up and literally _stuck his finger inside of her_, then ran away. She yelled out about what happened, pointed at the guy, and a bunch of Indian dudes tackled him and beat the ever living fuck out of him.\n\nIt\u2019s such a horrible story but hearing this did make me realise that it\u2019s definitely a small number of guys causing the problem there, and there are guys who want to do the right thing and get rid of India\u2019s reputation of being unsafe for women. But it\u2019s probably an uphill battle.",

When we visited Buenos Aires we were explicitly told not to go some places without a local with us and a good reason to be there, because we would be kidnapped and ransomed. She scoffed and later told me we should visit some place in one of those zones and it would be an \"adventure\". Took me Googling kidnapping stories for her to drop it. Then we went to Chile and she wanted to go walk in the industrial zones and flavalas to \"connect with the locals\". Fucking insanity to me.",

Let's say I really can't stand Pepsi. I could take one of the following options.\n\nOption A: Boycott Pepsi by not buying any of there products and maybe voicing my opinion of the evil deeds they do online and in person to raise awareness.\n\nOption B: Break into a bunch of pepsi warehouses and smash pepsi products and harass and send death threats to people who work at pepsi.\n\nNow can you discern which is a legal boycott and an illegal one?",

Option B isnt a boycott at all. Claiming it is an \"illegal boycott\" when it is really \"destruction of property, breaking and entering, and vandalism\" is Orwellian doublespeak because you want to twist an actual boycott around into a crime. Just like when twitter sued its own advertisers for boycotting twitter. source: https://www.npr.org/2025/02/01/nx-s1-5283271/elon-musk-lawsuit-advertisers-boycott-new. By claiming stuff is an \"illegal boycott\" when it is not you are feeding into the using of language for things it is not. I already cited the oxford dictionary for you. no where is destruction of propery anywhere in its definition.",

He retired and also started a family that year, he was only 36 at the time, but he packed on 50lbs like it was nothing. \n\nGoing from 5 days a week of working out to caring for his baby, being able to see friends/family all the time, who always wanted to go out and grab a slice of pizza, and only working three weeks a year had wrecked havoc on him. \n\nHe ended up getting a TV gig so he went crazy on a weight loss plan to look good for cameras but lack of guard rails and previous food intake levels will make you a fatty in no time. \n\nI know a lot of the other dudes he played managed to not do that but many of them had older established families that promoted them being active.  Little kids kick the shit out of you.",

So people stop working out, as an athlete they work out for 4-6 hours a day, and they're used to enormous calorie usage and take over the years have adapted their calorie intake to suit. When they stop, their body continues requesting the same intake but no longer has as much output.\n\nThe reverse happens to people who suddenly start doing physical labour for a new job or a new sport. It takes about 3 months for them to increase their calorie intake, but in that time they lose a lot of weight.",

In the US, even though the system is almost completely dominated by the two big parties, the Pirate party came close to winning some seats in some state legislatures, which is insane for U.S. politics. For the Czech Pirate Party, I think they got something like 20% of the national vote (feel free to fact-check me there, because I'm drawing on memory).",

Thus you don't know if the outrage or protests or whatever are doing anything, which burns out people fast\n\nThe metaphor I use is a house on fire. Watching your House burn down is always stressful. But if you had already made a plan, practice it with family, gotten the kids and pets out, called the relevant authorities, made sure you didn't make the fire worse, still standing on lawn watching your House burn down is stressful. \n\nHowever, knowing that you did what you could makes it unbelievably less stressful than if you were standing there watching it burn down, not knowing what to do, not doing anything. \n\nAnd ofc sometimes the fire brigade shows up in time to save the house or limit damage and salvage a good amount.\n\nHaving your hands on a local issue gives you purpose. You don't have to dedicate your life, it can literally be a few hours a month that has an incredible impact and is desperately wanted by those who are already fighting.\n\nThe fastest way to plug in is to look up previous protests in your area, check out the Articles to see who hosted them, and look up those organizations - join their mailing list on their website, follow them on social media, and go to an upcoming event that looks interesting. Ask the host or organizer the best way to get plugged in, how you can learn organizing or what roles to take that would help that fits your time availability, and what other local issues are being organized around.",

War disrupts corporate profits, international trade.\u00a0\n\n\nThe most powerful entities on earth will do anything to prevent that from happening at a significant level. China needs us, we need them, our relationship goes far deeper than the national theater of tariffs would have you believe.\u00a0\n\n\nIn terms of war, there is real potential for\u00a0 Saudis to be allying with Israel against Iran, actually taking action.\u00a0\n\n\nWe'd be dragged into that, but ultimately it wouldn't mean a draft going into proper effect, moreso just higher prices. And watching videos of atrocities, death, in war ofc.\u00a0\n\n\nWe are insulated, this is also why there wasn't enough pressure to end Gaza atrocities - US citizens weren't dying in that conflict en masse, enough to piss off their families at home who have the commitment to protest, that is far more than ideological motivation or born out of guilt in complicity. I might be wrong so I'm always open to hearing about US anti war movements that had serious success, yet no US citizens were dying",

But they generally try to avoid lawsuits they know they cannot win. The Presidency has also been gradually expanding its power over the past 50 years, but incrementally. Meanwhile, Trump is straight up doing things that are blatantly anti-constitutional, and just packing it in daily. Can list them, if you even care.\n\nNo other administration has simply ignored the checks and balances and said King Louis shit like \"We are the law.\" \nThis is a totally new ballgame, absolutely unprecedented in our history, and it really does threaten to end our country as a democracy.",

But if one doesn't, then he can either push it under the rug, or he can tell people that the other politicians are going against him, that they want to get him out of power, or the trans agenda is winning or whatever excuse he has to make people angry and turn against their own government, like he did with Jan. 6th. \n\nIt's dictatorship 101.  \n  \n It'ss never that they don't actually have political power in a normal state with a normal government under basic democracy, it's that the Jews, or capitalism, or that they're losing their culture to the West, so they have to fight to put \"the right man\" in charge.",

The biiiiiiiiig 1.7 trillion dollar issue is student loans. 93% of all student loans are federally backed by the Department of Education, and dats a problem. Since federal loans were introduced in the 60s (around the early 60s, some education bill, I can't remember exactly), student loan debt has been growing alot faster. In the big picture, damn near everyone can get a federal loan to go to college! Yaaay! Colleges know this very well. What do you do if your customer (college students) have access to guaranteed money? Jack your prices and pass the bill to students. Colleges are directly supported by the government under the disguise of a free market system, and those two don't play well together.\n     Anyhoo, that's why you would dissolve it, I don't agree with dissolving the whole shebang, our kids K-12 are dumb enough. But de-funding the loans entirely would do wonders in the long run.",

Every kid in high school is ushered into going to college or a trade school (like myself). What they can't cover from savings and other means, is covered by loans from the Feds. Private loans are around, but it's hard to compete with Uncle sam. A college would have zero incentive to have competitive pricing with other colleges. All students are guaranteed money bags walking in their doors. I'd jack my rates up to if everyone had tons of easy money to spend. I'm not familiar with the European system if you could elaborate.",

In Romania or the Netherlands, the state basically pays for either a certain number of students (meaning that lets say, 100 students are paid for, thus the remaining 100/200/whatever need to pay put of pocket) or pays a certain percent of the tuition cost and let's the remaining sum be paid by the student (usually in the range of a few thousands per year)\n\n\nI'm pretty sure something similar happens in most countries in europe. I guess the main difference is that universities can't just raise prices however they like since they depend (sometimes entirely) on state funds",

Tariffs and trade-wars have been repeatedly and consistently shown to be bad policy literally to the point of being in every econ 101 textbook? TDS! Trump wants to nuke Chicago? Well the liberals live there, and they're corrupt! I know it's hard for you to believe, but people hate Trump because his policies are stupid, and they remain stupid even after hearing Trump's paper-thin justifications.\n\nIf you want to fight corruption, ok, then do that, provide evidence of corruption, then provide targeted policies to fight it. Eliminating the DoE completely does not accomplish this, that's like trying to lose weight by cutting off your legs.. without even measuring your weight first!",

It tracks whether schools are following laws, assists them in correction if they are not, collects education data across the country, administers financial aid like pell grants etc. It's job isn't really to improve education, it's to provide information to schools and congress (which yes presumably improves education as a second order effect).",

It's setting an unrealistic standard of what an overweight person looks like.",

If 95% pants have little pockets, of course it's going to sell well because it's what's available. Rather than going out of your way to hunt the 5% pants with decent pockets, you just pick whatever you can grab.",

When true pockets first appeared women wore mostly dresses (because it was 1600s) and pants were mostly made for men, because of that women were still using pouches that you put on a belt/rope around your waist because it was more convenient than having pockets in free flowing dresses and during that time function in women's clothing wasn't a big deal. Later when industrialisation hit and mass produced clothing started to appear, women clothing's lack of pockets was a status quo, so mass producing companies didn't bother with wasting material to make them, and if they did they kept them small because people assumed that they were unnecessary for them.\n\n\nAnswer in progress made a good [video](https://youtu.be/jA_elEw-Oog) about this topic if you want to learn more about it, also my explanation might contain some oversimplifications and interpretations that may not be entirely correct because I wrote that from memory without fact checking myself too much so if you are actually interested in it watch the video :\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jA_elEw-Oog",

The pockets are deep, they're not branded, they're solid and last a few years, they're easily sewn back up if you rip them--my only complaint is that they're too long and I'm 5'4 lol. But they stay up without a belt and fit like men's pants on me, so I'll take it.",

As to not encrouge the thought that someone might pick it wanting to read about her or even have their eyes drawn towards it because of a young girl (it not for those people), as she's a character but you're meant to focus on the narrator.  \n  \nThe movie (Kubrick's) did irreparable damage to this idea.   \nNot just because the movie goes with the overly sexual aspects instead of focusing on the idea that narrator is a slimey manipulative/unreliable creep, but all his promotional material and posters were pics of her.",

If Walt were a real person I'd want him arrested immediately while feeling terrible for his poor wife, but since he's fictional I want him to evade police and ruin his marriage all for my entertainment.",

In the book he has a \u2018mild panic attack\u2019 upon going to Allen's apartment and seeing that it's nicer than his own. He also measures his interests by trying to show off to other people \u2014 he genuinely has nothing he can enjoy on his own, other than drugs, sex and violence. In the author's own words, Bateman is a loser. Nothing about him is actually cool.\n\nBtw, comparison with Nabokov is quite apt, because many of his main characters are small-scale bourgeoisie with their little banal indulgences, offputting just like Humbert even disregarding his sexual tendency, and it's also obvious that Nabokov didn't like his protagonists and constantly mocked them.",

I think it's not unreasonable that the way they portrayed it, it still feels more like it's glorifying that lifestyle and just pretends to have a deeper message. It's been a while though so maybe I'm wrong about the last part. I just remember how nearly everyone who has seen it just felt motivated to live a similar life afterwards instead",

Which mastery is evident even in his early stories. However, idk if he made that comment too soon into his English-language career, as stuff like \u2018Ada, or Ardor\u2019 seems pretty good to me.",

I don't agree with it because it's a one-sided love or obsession more like. Doesn't really fit into a love story in my book. I do however think it more fits into the tragedy category. Especially when you realize &gt;!Dolores\u00a0dies along with her baby as mentioned in the foreword.!&lt; Nothing good befalls anyone in the novel except for Rita I guess. \n\nAnyway I have to agree with the other comment in saying its a beautifully written novel. Nabokov has a way with words that make even the most abhorrent of themes captivating.",

I was out of control, I became insatiable, and, you know, after about a thousand nights like that, you start to lose it. I started to wonder: Where am I going with this? Why do I feel this need to fuck all these women? What is desire? The form of this cute Asian girl, why does it have such a grip on me? Because she\u2019s the opposite of me? Is she gonna complete me in some way? I realized I could fuck a million women, I\u2019d still never be satisfied \u2014 maybe what I really want is to be one of these Asian girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, one night, I took home some girl who turned out to be a ladyboy, which I\u2019d done before, but this time, instead of fucking the ladyboy, the ladyboy fucked me, and It was kind of magical. And I got in my head, what I really wanted was to be one of these Asian girls getting fucked by me, and to feel that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I put out an ad looking for a white guy my age to come over and fuck me, got a guy that looked a lot like me. Then, I put on some lingerie and perfume, made myself look like one of these girls \u2014 I thought: I look pretty hot. And then this guy came over and railed the shit out of me, then I got addicted to that \u2014 some nights, three, four guys would come over and rail the shit out of me. Some I even had to pay, and at the same time, I\u2019d hire an Asian girl who\u2019d just sit there and watch the whole thing. I\u2019d look in her eyes while some guy is fucking me, and I\u2019d think: \u2018I am her and I\u2019m fucking me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, we all have our Achilles heel, man, you know?\u201d Frank goes on. \u201cWhere does it come from? Why are some of us attracted to the opposite form and some of us the same? Sex is a poetic act, it\u2019s a metaphor; a metaphor for what? Are we are our forms? Am I a middle-aged white guy on the inside, too? Or inside, could I be an Asian girl? \u2026 I guess I was trying to fuck my way to the answer, then I realized, I gotta stop the drugs, the girls, trying to be a girl. I got into Buddhism, which is all about spirit versus form, detaching from self, getting off the never-ending carousel of lust and suffering. Being sober isn\u2019t so hard, being celibate, though, it\u2019s\u2026 I still miss that pussy, man.\u201d",
