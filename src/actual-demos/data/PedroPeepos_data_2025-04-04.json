He took another step towards the shack as he recalled the stories of this mystical sage, a talented EU jungler and team manager and community mod which ancient tales had foretold would take him to the promised land of not-bronze 3. As he got closer the door opened and a friendly voice reached out to him through his ears and piercing his soul.*\n\n\"*wide meal pov?\"* said the stranger\n\n\"*xdd\"* replied Caedrel",

But I get that there is a rule that you cant stream scrims which doesnt make sense but whatever. The part I dont get is why they cant just temporary allow it just like LCS did for this split or even just for this scrim block to see the result and stats they gain etc. Marketing masterclass by LEC therefore by Riot. Where is our european Mark Zimmerman when we need him.",

I think G2 are also on a good path.\n\nRiot also should be doing more, like creating skins for teams etc. and properly profit sharing with the teams, doubt we will ever see the day though.

The mods should stop being so insecure and read their own rules.\n\nEdit: Literally everyone who commented on the post got permabanned as well. The reason given has been ''brigading'' but literally nobody did that? People who commented both normally, and the people who said stuff like ''o7'', ''here before perma'' all got perma'd. This is disgusting behavior.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a80sq5nz0fqe1.png?width=1054&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8af6d682e3589bf924d40ae442b4b970a9142c2c",

I remember him in a few post match threads mocking pro players and fans in a very disrepectful way and when everyone called him out he deleted his own comment and all the replies (with some of the other mods covering his ass). They even banned some people. I DMed ahritina, SNSDave (who punished at least one, if not many, of the users) and the mod team and I got no response from them.\n\nI'm like 90% sure ahritina was just bait posting to ban people for fun because he did it a few times.",

Same percentage as most other games but the quality is skankhunt level. Okay maybe a few more trolls than other games XD but I imagine it's cuz of how much money is tied up in it. I used to play swtor with these two guys that their entire income came from lol tourneys. Eventually had to kick um from guild cuz it's all you'd hear in teamspeak and they'd get so shitty if you told um to go to a diff room or just not talk about it for 5 minutes. Like bruh, we're in the middle of this thing called a raid, tank and healers need to talk.",

From what I understand they offered Zeus a 1+1 T1\u2019s choice contract (they choose if Zeus plays the 2nd year). HLE offered a 1+1 players choice (Zeus would choose 2nd year). Clearly a better contract at HLE. I\u2019m pretty sure HLE offered more money too. \n\nT1 then also accused Zeus\u2019s contracting agency of doing what is AGAINST Zeus\u2019s best interest because the agency \u2018wanted to make more money\u2019 (due to marketing money being the best it could be with T1 instead of HLE). The agency said this was completely untrue because they don\u2019t make any money off of Zeus\u2019s marketing. So they just negotiated what ZEUS wanted. Pretty sure they said T1 had been shady about this stuff in the past too.\n\nThing is, BEFORE Joe Marsh started bitching about it, T1 literally just lost in negotiations to HLE. That\u2019s it. HLE made a better offer and clearly has a team that could also compete internationally.\n\nCouple that with what Joe marsh did with Guma, *forcing* Guma into the starting position despite the team wanting Smash to start, and T1 just looks really bad after all of this. At least Joe Marsh specifically. \n\nIWD goes over all of it in the video. He\u2019s anti-T1 biased, so take what he says with a grain of salt, but he isn\u2019t lying about what he\u2019s reading. He\u2019s just reading an article about it too.  I definitely might\u2019ve not had this fully accurately, but that\u2019s the gist of it. T1 lost in negotiations and didn\u2019t really offer Zeus what he deserved, and Joe fucked with the Guma/Smash decision, and now Joe is complaining about it. Bad look from T1 and the main sub mods at all T1 fans so they don\u2019t want anyone posting anti-t1 stuff.",

Their reason was because i \"addressed an individual\" and thats against their rules. I never did such a thing (didnt even address a single person, just the LEC team in general) and was giving them evidence and other examples of posts, that had the same phrasings as mine, and they still are up to this day. Instead mine was taken down for no reason. And it was a super positive post to begin with. \n\nThats why i agree with your statement, that they are powerhungry. No decent moderator would take down such a post. \n\nAnd to add a bit of fuel: It baffels me that they still let the Thorin video/post up despite it being hateful, with no evidence provided and it addressed an individual personally. It broke at least 3 rules! And its still up. Thats just sad.",

Because they had no leg to stand on and they knew that.  They were just emotionally lashing out because they \u2019lost face\u2019.  Maybe Zeus wanted to leave or maybe his team played hard ball to get better terms.  But that was well within his rights as a free agent.  It was always funny to me that T1 tried paint themselves as some naive company that blindly trusted Zeus so they had no backup plan.  I think their ego got the best of them and they just assumed Zeus would re-sign.  Imagine the shit a pro sports team would get if they said something like that about their FA.  Everyone knows that if a player doesn\u2019t sign before FA starts, there is a good chance you can lose them to other teams, that is kind of the point of free agency.\n\n  \nAnd this new Guma/Smash situation.  Even if it was indeed Joe Marsh who stepped in to make Guma the starter, why say that publicly.  It just puts Guma in a tougher situation.  If he has a bad game (which every player does), he is going to get so much shit.  Just say the decision was made to start Guma but Smash will have a chance to compete.",

This popped up on my Reddit feed, even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in any League subs. I don\u2019t even play League. like, at all*.* I\u2019m a DBD player.\n\nPower-tripping as a Reddit mod has to be one of the saddest things you can do. Modding should be about maintaining a community, not feeding your ego. A lot of these people have never moderated anything before, so they don\u2019t really get what it means.\n\nEvery platform I\u2019ve modded had clear, logical rules, no drinking, no NSFW content, basic stuff. But there? It\u2019s just mods enforcing some made-up quota so they can feel important. They don\u2019t realize it\u2019s all meaningless. Outside of Reddit, they have zero control over others. Modding should keep communities together, not dehumanize users or punish people just because you can.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the permaban, probably some overreach or a mod who never got told their job is to help, not make things worse.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: you\u2019ll never see these people outside of Reddit. They\u2019re invisible. Their whole existence depends on controlling others because they have no control over their own lives. I hope they find peace.",

I saw how Jankos (no shade) struggled a bit dealing with non-pros on RS and thought Odo could be the same way but he has been great at recognizing Baussi's solo queue thinking and shaping it toward pro play instead.  \n\nHis humour fits perfectly with them during ARAMs and 1v1s and he is good at talking trash but keeping it endearing instead of getting overly toxic etc.",

Like they are so perfectly top laner in their personalities and it really shows how neither backs down and is always glazing themselves and giving crap to the other roles and always up for a 1v1  it's so funny and so good for the whole team\n\nHe's also a cool head experienced international player and caster and veteran of the esport he has all the experience and success to compliment caedrel he's a truly perfect fit\n\nThis team/project by Sally is like the feel good story of 2025 they just keep stacking w's on and off the rift",

Velja responds more like a traditional player looking to go pro, he has plenty of content moments, but mostly he's just a fucking good player who seems like he'd make it big in pro even outside of LR. \n\nAnd dont get me wrong, i think baus is a very strong player, but velja is just much more consistent and doesnt need the team to build a playstyle around his specific playstyle unlike baus. Baus will seemingly always play like baus, even though he's seen colossal improvements as well.",

I mean shit even caedrel said that in the post finals interview and baus knows it himself. \n\nHis playstyle is unique and very strong imo, but he needs to refine it to win. He cant be as greedy as in soloq, and Caedrels triple D plan in part was specifically designed to stop players overplaying.\n\nTheres a reason baus has seemed so locked in since the KCB loss. Sally's plan has meant that baus is now more willing to drop waves to stop dying, or drop waves to rotate to teamfights. Discipline\n\nBaus 100% shouldnt change his style, but theres nothing wrong with refining it and making it pro play ready, which is what is happening.",

Professional jungling is the role that is the most dissimilar from SoloQ and needs the most discussion if you are trying to go pro. Especially in the last week, Velja has shown good composure and when he disagrees, he just says it. A month ago he would just take it. Jungle is the center of the conversation more than ever because the game is all about objectives every other minute.\n\nThe dude is actually the best mechanical player on the team. During the chicken fight where Neme gets caught by xin, he ducks into the brush, flashes onto Xin to finish him off 1v2 and makes sure all his attacks hit the chickens to trigger jg item and then while Rekkie CCs Ori, he back steps to Q the big chicken and Ori for the kill.\n\nYesterday this guy calls he is going to steal Xins Red buff 30s in adv, with no vision, blind flashes the baron wall and BOOM HE IS RIGHT ON TIME. He is a jungler who feasts on junglers. He is Blade.",

I feel like Crownie and Nemesis are good at holding it down when it's a losing fight but are generally more cautious for engages. Of course there is always a balance with this since the risk can lose the game but it came in clutch today and in the NLC finals as well.",

But again, why have notifications on if you know there's gonna be hundreds of posts spoiling the result?\n\nAlso the title would've spoiled it regardless, making the tag useless anyway. Afaik reddit has literally never changed that like they should've.\n\nI just don't get the argument when people are willingly opening social media apps and interacting, all while knowing there's thousands of posts waiting to spoil them, then getting mad that they got spoiled (not necessarily the person above, but I've seen people crying about it a shit ton). Literally one of the main rules of social media is to not open shit if you don't want it spoiled, whether its an event, show, music, movie, etc.",

I'm sorry to name drop, but if you had a camera for most hours on focus driven people like Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant you would see an analogy in the moments of just stone faced obsession and thinking of what they are doing. This guy lives in the game and is very competitive about it, which is also why he didn't play for so long, ironically. Again, you would see the same things on many people, successful or not, that have this kind of approach towards feelings such as competition and drive, in the respective field.",

And btw., we will have a 2nd esports winter soon if the stocks of sponsors keep tanking like they do at the moment because of uncertainty (e.g. tariffs)",

There's no one else that matches Caedrel's genuine-ness when it comes to League. It's proven more by the fact that there's nothing in that big-ass brain of his other than League of Legends. Bro can't cook a steak to save his life but he can cook up the most 3 Michelin star draft you've ever seen to win NLC.",

Even with league, players can't say anything that can be seen as problematic, heck even Caedrel, a caster at the time, almost got in trouble when he dropped the f-bomb during worlds 2022 even though it was completely warranted considering how hype that finals was. Riot just doesn't want to touch anything that might bring them controversy, despite being completely comfortable making their own playerbase upset over virtual boxes. Lmao\n\nThe disparity between the PG13 league and valorant esports scene and the constant cussing and trash-talking in other esports like dota and cs will tell you that this is a Riot thing and not a valorant issue.",

CS has always had problems finding \"normal\" sponsors, because they don't want their name associated with words like \"bomb\" and \"terrorists\" (same thing in MMA where your logo sprinkled with blood doesn't look great). This is why Valorant deliberately went with \"spike\" instead of bomb, and \"attackers/defenders\" instead of terrorists/counter-terrorists.\n\nIt's way easier to have a loose broadcast when the game dev is mostly hands-off and your sponsors are moral grey areas themselves like gambling sites and Saudi Arabia rather than Sony and Kit Kat for example. It's the same for regular sports or other broadcasts.\n\nValve makes a lot of money from cases and other micro transactions, but their money maker isn't CS or Dota, it's Steam. Their bottom line isn't affected if their games and esports side aren't making money, so they outsource almost everything they do and let 3rd party organizers do whatever they want. But that is because Valve is a unique outlier, no other game company can copy their model because most of them aren't private with massive passive income.\n\nRiot's revenue comes from their games, and their image is strongly tied to their titles. Catering to the Chinese market is something a lot of people attribute to being owned by Tencent since 2011, but other companies do this too (Blizzard and the Blitzchung controversy for example, but also regular companies like Apple etc.), because that market is often bigger than all the others combined. To put it into perspective, VCT Champs 2024 (Valorant's equivalent to Worlds) had **5 times** as many viewers as VCT Champs 2023 due to China.",

They play fraction of the games as LCK or LPL. And in case of KC , I saw ppl blaming Caliste when I have literally not seen a single game other then Yuumi where he was peeled or supported by anybody. He is literally playing solo all game and as Caedrel pointed out even when he went pushing his team fucked it up for him, this lack of cooperation is the reason they are losing, they are pouring everything into mid and jgl, too bad Yike is just running it down now (probably because of communication problems).\n\nSo the problem is, always new teams, contantly changing even during the same year, talents squandered, no communication learned. And even if they have academy teams that level of leage is not organized enough to properly filter talents and as I said get squandered. Like for example I don't understand why Yike was let go from G2, they had good synergie, proper chance to improve now they got jgl and support who are just as coinflip as Humanoid, Razork, Hylli or Targa. All of G2 was on Caps or BB this whole split, if they are bad or can't carry they lose. Jgl is non existent, and Hans Sama can't gain agency because his support is also non existent so his laning phase where support is the most important is also off.",

My cope was thinking that \u201cIt\u2019s just the first tournament, surely everything will be okay for MSI and Worlds, right?\u201d But it has gotten to the point where having hope for EU every year is pointless. Ibai said this too on stream. Still love the region and the players, though. This is why more and more western fans start supporting LCK/LPL more, they will just always deliver in internationals.",

It just feels like watching division 1 football when the Premier league is right there. Just kind of a \"Yay team x beat team y in this super tight final, but oh right, I'm not even close to watching the peak of this game. Any of the actual good teams would have stomped these guys.\" tyoe of feeling. Knowing that there are other leagues out there on a completely different level just takes the excitement out of it for me idk. No hate to anyone following western leagues obviously tho",

Dude their ADC is literally a kid named Caliste who started to play this split lmao. Chill, give them time to get shit on and learn.\n\nNewcomers of the LEC, people only joined after G2 dominating era etc dont remember it but West was never good against east. Perkz didnt became Perkz (international level Perkz) with just 1 tournament. They also had terrible international experiences but Perkz Jankos etc kinda players getting experienced and Caps joining the league change everything in LEC. Because now we had 2 Perkz's or 2 Caps's however you like it.\n\nMy point is, its their first international. They deserved to lose so i thing its a good think for them. Is it terrible for fans, for us? OFC but especially younger people should stop acting like we were winning every worlds or MSI before lol.\n\nNA doesnt even have a fuckn win against asians or its like at a terrible percentage like 10-15% of smt like that.\n\nWe were good worldwide because we had 2 great teams which had Caps and Rekkles at their primes. Except Caps and Rekkles there is nothing when you look at West vs East. But Vladi can be next Caps. Dude improved like crazy. If he keeps learning and working, no joke he can easily become a top tier mid laner that LEC needs for years. Caliste is very good, its his first split and dude already showed so many great things imo.\n\nTLDR, Let them play and lose if they have to. Recent years we suck at internationals because of this mentality. If they are better than us, learn their ways and counter it just like G2 did back in 19.\n\nPersonally im happy that finally we actually have 2 promising rookies. Also, i really love the guy, he never said or done anything even tho everybody hates him, Targamas. But he is really not good enough for top level plays. That was his problem back in G2 days either. That G2 was the weakest internationals G2 ive ever saw and most of that was caused by G2 bot lane. He is for sure good enough to win LEC in a decent roster, he proved that 2 times now ig but when he faces better supports or when the teams need him to do smt extra, he just cant. Idk why, i think Mikyx would be pretty strong with Caliste for example.",

I was pointing at the missing balance inside the system. If we, as people, aren\u2018t able to find other forms of punishment for a very bad humor while emotions taking over and without harm, regarding this topic, after nearly 100 years, instead going minus tolerance while on the other side nearly tolerating sexual abuse, racism at workplace or physical aggression in everyday life in comparison. Then we just lost our sense for balance. That\u2018s all I\u2018m saying. And makes me sad to see that it is even received this way.",

We will be reaching out to the mods of LR's opponents during each scrims block and we will be sharing lists of chatters who decide to go there and spread negativity, hate or any toxicity. Doing so will lead to **instant and permanent bans** in Caedrel's chat and the chats of the other LR boys as well. \n\nThe majority of our community has been nothing but supportive and appreciation posts about not just LR but even enemy teams have been popping up on the subreddit and we are very grateful for that. Sadly, with a community this large (and growing every day), there will be toxic and annoying rats who think that somehow putting down the opposition makes LR look better - in fact, it does the exact opposite.\n\nWe want to help build a community that spreads positivity and we will do our best to do so. If any of you spot a chatter that you suspect from drama baiting or spreading toxicity and negativity, please feel free to reach out to our mods on Twitch and let them know.\n\nThanks for being awesome rats and see you around, xddkiss.",

Even if you're right and Baus map pressure means less deaths on the map than supports usually have (fair enough), supports tend to also rack up a lot of teamfight deaths on engage. Rekkles playing more ranegd support than average is definitely a factor, but if the team had close matches more often I think he'd shoot up simple because engage supports die for a good engage combo a lot.",

Sometimes I get bored with melee because it's a lot of running into the enemy's face and just causing problems. Not to say it's less skilled, but it feels like I have lots of ways to influence the map and move when I play ranged. IDK THO IM NOT GOOD AT GAME i just play w my friends :)))",

If he didn't play subway surfers maybe he could have drafted better against KCB, a silver 3 draft instead of bronze 3",
