Walz is so incompetent that he added strangers to the mix and didn\u2019t realize it. Hegseth is also very incompetent by telling the others there information about US strike packages, sequencing, and tactics. Such information shouldn\u2019t be shared anywhere! There\u2019s no need for Tulsi or Walz or to know the exact strategy that we use.\n\nSecond this is a violation of government records. As they worked for US government and they are on government phone their records should be kept, not deleted after X days.\n\nThis is so incompetent! Anyone doing this in the military would get booted immediately.",

I dont know how important he is to Trumps overall goals but at a minimum he needs to publicly explain himself like how and why and he needs to apologize for putting the missions and American personnel at risk.",

Or that they are using freaking *Signal* to communicate. \n\nI suspect this is just a symptom of the larger character of unprofessionalism that seems to perpetually dog this administration. There needs to be a real investigation into what other matters are being handled so flippantly. Walz should be fired, and if Hegseth can't adequately get ahead of this, he needs to go too. \n\nWhen the DoD is involved, there is no room for \"three strikes\". It might have been an accident, but accidents imply negligence. These are exactly the type of weaknesses our enemies will wait for and exploit.",

I was looking through the chat after the last post then I realized, I have whatsap and signal on my phone and both are there ONLY for communications with other people in the military. I totally get your point, we aren't like deploying the 8th air force or anything over signal, but I think folks would be surprised to find out how similar high ups are to normies. Just in that they're probably like \"yeah drone strike that shit\" as casually as I'm like \"yeah I can use AT days for the trip to PACAF this year\".\n\nedit: I should be clear, I'm not defending them, I guess I'm just also not surprised.

I can't read the full article at The Atlantic, so eh...\n\nRegardless of who did it, and using Signal aside, it's fucking strange to have journalists in your contacts list anyways.  \n\nI have to wonder how it got on to Waltz's list.  Is the phone he used from the former person in that office or...?\n\nSo many little questions, *especially* considering which journalist it was:\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/author/jeffrey-goldberg/\n\nThe articles on Trump are TDS af.\n\nSomeone else posted a \"gift\" link so peopel can read the whole article, which I'm doing now:\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=kPTlqn0J1iP9IBZcsdI5IVJpB2t9BYyxpzU4sooa69M&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share",

Not only is it illegal to transmit classified information through A) unapproved means and B) to someone without proper clearance and a need to know that information...It is in fact a crime to fail to REPORT that this has happened if you are even remotely aware of it. At the very least, anyone else would have their device seized and it would be investigated by the FBI to contain and sanitize the classified spill. Yeah, it's a bad look alright.",

The Atlantic could\u2019ve been a lot worse - dumping classified info to put our military assets at risk and thereby harm the administration. This article is surprisingly constrained, props to the author for the journalistic integrity\n\nSo with that, Michael Walz should be fired (at a bare minimum) and I honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Hegseth is shown the door too after this. At a fundamental level I\u2019m not opposed to Signal. The government probably has archaic private internal communications and they want something faster that\u2019s still encrypted. But they should get Signal approved for government usage and of course have the appropriate safeguards in place to prevent something like this from happening. This is just sheer ineptitude. The Atlantic was generous enough to handle this situation with tact. Imagine if they added random people on Signal to other chats containing even more critical information.\n\nEdit: well I take back my compliment about journalistic integrity since this hack editor decided to leak the entire chat history. It\u2019s certainly not a good look for the Atlantic, though I still stand by Mike Waltz needing to be fired.",

Working in DoD for a very long time, and this is just fucking pathetic. They have appropriate channels for this. Idk why they would do this other than to skip all the red tape and share info real time.",

He said he didn\u2019t know this journalist at all, then how would he have his phone number?\n\nThe screenshot says that he added him to the group and then started the text messaging. Is he saying that it was a staffer using his phone and writing the text messages on his behalf?\n\nUnfortunately there needs to be some consequences here, heads need to roll, otherwise it\u2019s a double standard.",

It's reasonable that his office has him in any number of large group chats that contain reporters.\n\nIt's certainly more believable than the idea that someone secretly got in his phone and edited his contacts to include this reporter as someone else who would be included who happened to share the same initials, as he kind of hinted as a possibility on Ingraham.  I seriously doubt that this was some elaborate deep state conspiracy coordinated to embarass him.  It's most likely a tech fuck up that can happen to anyone but shouldn't happen with sensitive info.",

There's gotta be more there. At worst Mike is a rat and trying to make the administration look bad. At best it was a stupid mistake, but the administration still looks bad. And its defenders look like morons- is Signal secure or not? If not, heads should roll. If it is, how were they able to add a reporter? Heads should still roll.\n\n\nThe mental gymnastics and semantics of \"war plans\" vs \"attack plans\" is a really bad look. Trump should have blown up, fired Mike Waltz immediately and gave Hegseth/Vance a dressing-down at the very least. No accountability for clear fuckups.",

Seriously, how dumb can you be?\n\nApparently really dumb. Now there's an argument that everyone who just lied to congress should resign. How can they continue to have the trust of the president under these circumstances? The whole situation is absolutely bonkers.",

The point is only this: could the Houthis mitigate US strikes and/or harm US personnel/materiel using this non-public information? The answer has to be yes. It needs to be examined on this basis and questions need to be asked why this information is being discussed outside of official channels and how that can be avoided in future.",

I said much the same thing in a much much larger post, heh.\n\n&gt; It needs to be examined on this basis\n\nEspecially that part, that's the crux of OpSec.\n\nI don't think the answer is yes based on what was in the full group chat.  No targets identified at time of the initial strike.  It was already announced there would be attacks, anyone that paranoid would already be in a bunker somewhere safe.\n\nThey'd have learned nothing new on the timeline where they could take action or endanger anything....again, on that enemy and that timeline the chat happened on.  Nothing actionable that they had ability to affect.  (A different enemy, one capable of shooting down F-18s with reliability and on short notice, that may be a different judgement)\n\nAs for why Signal, and Why Waltz invited that Journo....yeah, that's still terrible.\n\nBut it's not as bad as that Journo and Dem's are trying to stir up.",

Seeing that the &gt; strike packages consisted of F/A-18, there is no need to activate the AESA radars as F/A-18 is not stealth and older radars can see them with no problems.\n\nHate to tell you this - but every country that has them already has them turned on 24/7...  they would not be turning on the radar because of a text message.\n\nThey might watch it more closely than usual, and might prep planes and anti-air stations earlier than usual, but they were monitoring the radar the whole time.\n\n&gt; the circle of probability of our carrier location is shrinking.\n\nI also guarantee you that the chinese, russians, and possibly others (india?) know the location of every carrier group in the world at all times via sat surveillance.  The only naval assets they can't easily track are subs.\n\nI'm not saying this breach isn't bad - it is...  but you are badly misconstruing the level of advantage our adversaries get from it.",

Given her background she knows damn well this was against regs. I see nothing wrong with holding people accountable no matter which side of the aisle they are on. Especially if that accountability protects US servicemen and women in the future from being put at risk due to a similar leak. I\u2019m growing real tired of people in this sub implying people don\u2019t have conservative values simply because they are willing to criticize the current admin. I\u2019m well aware of the visitors from other subs and there may be bad actors here. But I\u2019ve also seen members who have been here for years and contributed a ton be ridiculed simply because they have opinions.",

I believe this should result in Trump being impeached. \n\nI also think we should collectively ignore how the rat-reporter had an opportunity to be a *good citizen* and decided to use the moment to a) undermine the admin, b) undermine the attack effort; c) self aggrandize\n\nAfter all, the best thing to do when you are accidentally given top secret information is to publicize it. It doesn't jeopardize lives at all.",

Even Mike Waltz is saying that one of his staffers added the person, not him, but since it happened in his office he is taking full responsibility. But no, this can't be a nefarious staffer that is trying to sabotage the Trump administration in some way by \"accidentally\" adding a known anti-Trump reporter to a private Signal channel.\n\nLmao, there's clearly more that happened here and it reeks of internal sabotage. Mike Waltz is taking the responsibility for it happening. He even said that the person was added had a different name over their number, sort of like how let's say you change your spouse's name to \"wife\" or something like that, instead of their name. Well, someone had this reporter's name changed to something else, clearly in an effort to obfuscate who it really was.\n\nNow, why would one of Waltz's staffers who added the individual do this? Purely accidental right, like they just happened to have a known anti-Trump journalist's telephone number stored in their directory under the wrong name on accident, right?\n\nBut ya, the entire Trump military administration must resign... of course lol.\n\nTrump's right, this is turning into a witch hunt by the media. and they are even trying to say that somehow Hillary Clinton trying to bypass the Records Act by secretly using her own private email server in her home, secretly using classified information on non-authorized devices is somehow the equivalent of this.\n\nThese people are insane.",

I'm kind of paranoid.\n\nHowever.\n\nWhile I'm still in the camp that we need all the facts and dust to settle, this ain't looking good.",

This is a discovery request as part of the 14 state lawsuit that wanted her to issue a restraining order for DOGE which she refused...\n\n&gt;In a ruling on February 18, 2025, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan declined to issue a temporary restraining order that would have blocked (DOGE) from accessing federal employee data or making personnel changes. This decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic-led states seeking to limit DOGE\u2019s authority.  Chutkan determined that the states failed to prove \"imminent, irreparable harm,\" a necessary legal threshold for such an emergency injunction, though she acknowledged their broader concerns about Musk\u2019s unchecked power and the constitutionality of his role as legitimate questions for future litigation.\n\nWith the Musk team, I'm assuming her request is kind of a softball for them.  If she doesn't like the answers &amp; chooses to hinder them (seems unwise), I'd bet on a SCOTUS appeal.",

But I can still go to any of the Marxist subreddits here and speak truth, while my messages are not removed, they do accumulate large numbers of downvotes. \n\nConversely, I can go to any conservative subreddits, and I can post a truthful and accurate comment, but inevitably I will have my comment removed. They tell me that my comments are being removed due to my karma rating, but leaving them up would be the best way to improve my karma rating. In reality, they have created an environment where there is no way to overcome negative karma.\n\nOf course, Conservative subreddits believe they are doing God's work and protecting members from malcontents, but in reality, this only stifles free speech and helps the leftists. \n\nThe way the conservative subreddits rely on someone's \"karma\" rating as a legitimate reason to remove someone's comments without reviewing them reminds me of how so-called conservatives in Congress always talk tough on the cable news shows but where the rubber meets the road, they fold like lawn chairs and vote to support Democrat legislation.  \n\nI have my doubts that this comment will be left up for long.

I wasn't around then, but the speech has been televised since 1947. The partisan nature of the applause didn't start until 1982. According to [this Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/01/a-political-history-of-the-state-of-the-union/70136/), during a Reagan speech, Republicans and Democrats had been distributed separate notes, with the notes given to Republicans having applause cues and the notes given to Democrats not having them.\n\nDemocrats responded to this by acquiring an early text of the next Reagan speech and going through it and writing their own cues of when to cheer, again serving their own agenda by picking and choosing. Later, this morphed into the other party just not reacting to much of anything that a president would say.\n\nAccording to [this 2013 intelligencer article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/02/state-of-the-union-applause-fest.html), Democrats at the time tended to make far more applause cues than Republicans, often to the point of absurdity.\n\nSo, at least according to those sources, Reagan started it and then Democrats kinda magnified it, taking it to a much larger level, and it's been a thing ever since.\n\nAnd myself? I hate it. It's been the norm over my whole life and I hate every moment of it. It makes me feel poorly represented, makes me have less faith in our government. It drives in how divided we are as a country. I also hate the practice of doing it along party lines. It drives how the two-party system has such a lock-hold on government. It reinforces the idea that the two parties are incapable of working together. I see all these things as deep problems, things we need to stop accepting as the norm and instead challenge and move beyond. It's important to me that both we as a society, and the reps we elect to congress, are able to work out our (and their) differences and build a consensus on important issues. I don't expect people to agree on everything, but if we are as divided as we are today, I can't see our government as anything other than broken.",

I really feel like if he cut out the pettiness and really focused on \"making America great\" he's in a position to do it. And the biggest thing holding him back is massive ego and what honestly feels like a desire to get revenge on those who wronged or disrespected him. I say that as a person who was a certifiable Trump hater. Yeah I know he's doing a lot of stuff that's been a long time coming, but if the Democrats get control at midterms because he turned too many voters against him, the pendulum is just going to swing back to where we were under Biden.",

Trump will always be a bull in the China shop.  It's what we love and hate about him.",

So I agree with Joe Rogan, in this case.  \n  \nI mean, reciprocal tariffs are fine, even protectionist tariffs, based on our national security or domestic interests, but it was Trump who negotiated the USMCA, so why tear it apart now?  \n  \nAnd if we're going to tear it up, okay fine, then do so respectfully, rather than casting Canada, or Mexico, as our enemies.  And be honest about the reason as to why we're undoing our agreement.  \n  \nThere is a time for tough words, but there's also a time for gentle diplomacy, an area where Trump is sometimes/often lacking.",

Pissing off the population of other countries will ensure the US will have unfriendly governments elected on those countries... Just look at the effect of this to the conservative party in canada. There is an art to diplomacy that seems to be absent in these shenanigans",

Because we didn\u2019t just let those breaches slide and we certainly wouldn\u2019t have allowed it to continue with full knowledge that it was happening right under our nose. Look at what happened to Snowden after he leaked classified documents or all of the (until recently) offensive cyber operations conducted by our military.\n\nSaying that, just because we have had data breaches in the past, it\u2019s ok to allow unauthorized access to data by anyone who works for the govt. is reckless.",

Maybe if you're a democrat president you know they will do what's best for dems so you are more than happy to let them decide and get rid of all the conservatives in their ranks. That's how we got to this point in the first place where 95% of DC is democrat. So no. Trump was elected to reign in the unelected democrat bureacracy and hold them accountable to the people for once and that's exactly what he is doing. The same \"management\" who gave us all these failures in the first place should not be given more power.",

We need to acknowledge reality or the left will use that reality to dominate midterm elections \n\nThe 22nd amendment specificies he can\u2019t be elected to a 3rd term. It could clearly be interpreted to mean that trump would become president if he was the speaker of the house as that is a line of succession and not an election if potus and vp stepped down voluntarily. And the house can elect anyone to be speaker even if they\u2019re not an elected official. In no way do I support this, I\u2019m just saying that there is actually a legal pathway. If we can\u2019t acknowledge that how can we effectively argue against it?\n\nHere is the full text of the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution:\n\n---\n\n**Section 1.** No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.\n\n**Section 2.** This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.\n\n\nArticle I section 2 clause 5 specifies the house can choose anyone to be speaker and there are no restrictions on who it is. They don\u2019t even have to be an elected official\n\n**Article I, Section 2, Clause 5** of the United States Constitution is a single sentence within the broader Section 2. Here is its full text:\n\n---\n\n\"The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\"\n\n---\n\n### Breakdown:\n- **\"The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers\"**: This grants the House the authority to elect its Speaker and other officials (like the Clerk or Sergeant-at-Arms) without specifying qualifications or procedures, leaving it to the House\u2019s discretion.\n- **\"and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment\"**: This gives the House exclusive authority to initiate impeachment proceedings against federal officials, including the President, Vice President, and other civil officers.",

I believe they can still then run for two more terms of their own.",

I think the fact that we are having this conversation should perhaps be a wake up call that Trump has jumped the shark. Or at very least acknowledge he is at high risk of doing so if he makes serious decisions to carry out this insane nonsense, which at this point I personally expect he will at some point.  Were in trouble. The Dems still suck in just about every way, and we appear to be going of the rails. It's rather depressing.",

And, at any rate, even if there is a loophole I'm not aware of, my thought is that anyone who runs in 2028 with the plan of trying to sneak Trump back into office wouldn't stand a chance of winning anyway.",

We arent going to become a unified country and actually achieve the goal of being a true America unless we figure out how to get the left out of their crazy bullshit. \n\nI dont wanna go through life hating the people I disagree with politically. We have different ideas but the point of this country is we hash out ideas and let the best ideas win but we will not be  able to achieve that in this current state. \n\nI think we need to be the mature people here, which we are, and make sure we let the left know their ideas are welcome here to debate in the conservative movement. The admins here have done a fantastic job with the debate threads for example. \n\nWe need to figure out a way how to unify again as a country...even though I disagree with the left on many things Im tired of this anger. I dont wanna have pointless fights for the sake of fighting with my fellow countrymen anymore, its exhausting.  I want a country where we can disagree but understand that we all want the best.",

Or, maybe there was some algo, but it wasn't nearly as heavy-handed as the current ones. \n\nAnyway, back then, the people that followed me and the ones I followed were a lot more random. There was a photographer in Ukraine that followed me and I followed him back (this was before the current war), and for some reason, I had a lot of Iranian followers. It had the net effect of making the world feel a little smaller in a good way, like it had this neat \"oh, look what I discovered\" effect. I think if we could find a way to divorce the social media from the algorithms, that would fix a lot- they were what led to the silos.",

Would be fascinating to see what kind of correlation is there.",

Most of Americans are just content with life and wanted a more peaceful life. They didn\u2019t want all of the division as well.\n\nWhat we do is to talk to them and see views from them as well. Some of their concerns are valid. For instance, some legitimate asylum seekers are being sent back as well. Some have concerns about trade wars and about Greenland. Instead of just dismissing them as \u201cstupid\u201d talk to them. And at times acknowledge that Trump\u2019s administration aren\u2019t perfect either.\n\nYou can also talk about local issues. Some GOP are so bad at local issues that at times you may have to agree on Democrats on some issues. GOP in my state wanted to create a toll road - it took a long time and it created havoc on the streets- be agreeable to Democrats on issues where they are right.",

Make it so that way its more affordable and cheaper for small buisneses to get health insurance for their employees. Its astronomically expensive for a small buisness with less than 10 employees to insure their staff...which means its hard for these business to hire people and grow as a business. Small business is one of the best ways for people to achieve  their own personal goals and freedoms because its something anyone can start. \n\nMake it so its easier to run and grow small business and insure employees....thats something that I imagine we on the right could even get behind.",

This subreddit is an echo chamber for conservatives, just like r/WhitePeopleTwitter or r/Liberal is an echo chamber for left leaning people (and Reddit as a whole is more left leaning).\n\nAs a European I also think that the US really doesn't benefit from essentially allowing just 2 parties. Yes, you can technically have independents, but they are practically set up to lose, because a vote for them is a vote that is basically lost and allows one of the 2 main parties to win. This is also exacerbated by the division, because both the right and the left hate each other's candidates and so it's not just about getting your candidate elected, but also making sure the other side's candidate does not win.\n\nAnd finally, the rampant disinformation or people taking the loudest voice in the room to be an example of the average person. The average democrat doesn't have pink hair or support terrorists and the average republican doesn't enjoy doing nazi salutes, and yet that is what Twitter and other echo chambers would like you to believe.",

I appreciate that there are still people on the Right who can rationalise (which I know you guys would say about the left too if they weren\u2019t screaming at you). I think both sides see the other as complete morons and thats just not true. We can work together and try to figure shit out in this fucked up internet based world. We are worried about free speech - free speech is threatened by anyone who silences an opinion they disagree with. I think the problem is that both sides have different opinions about what the social contract of free speech covers. I think we all need to try to work together to make a world where everyone can be safe except for those in power who take advantage of us.",

The only ways I see it short of civil unrest is a common enemy attacking us and we unite, or one side eventually controlling the executive and both houses for several elections.

They use emotions when on their keyboard versus critical thinking skills, or they are trying to get reactions to boost their numbers. \n\nAnother issue I see that ties in with this, is how many news sources are not just need, but op-ed instead. They tend to write attention grabbing headlines which can be misleading from the entire story for a few clicks. Many people read just the headlines and think they are informed. \n\nSo to fix this, it would be hard.  Sadly, the last time there was unity was 9/11. I don't want to see a tragedy like that again to bring people together.",

What i essentially mean is that nowadays in almost every political corner of the information space when new information comes out it doesn't get to the pubblic directly but often it arrives through a secondary source that reads it in a peculiar way and sometimes even changes it.   \n  \nFor example. Trump orders expansion of tree cutting areas which are connected to various animal habitats and the white house announces it, hopefully with a legal document attached. What will happen now is that we will hear it through  some type of news source might it be television, a conservative newspaper or even tiktok and we will hear about how Trump is increasing wood production to have to rely less on normal trading partners for wood. Democrats will hear through their medium that Trump is endagering wildlife species to benefit the logging lobby. And neither group will believe how outrageous it is that the other side is in favour or against this plan and neither group will even read the long document that actually explains how it will actually be done.\n\nIn private both groups will agree that they support an increase in timber as long as it doesn't harm too much the species at risk of extinction, but they will both believe the other group wants only one of those with no room for compromise. \n\nrinse and repeat for every cycle and every time the personal hate will increase.   \nI know this is a classic botheism, and one can argue on the percentage as much as they want, but at the end of the day, discussion with the same facts in mind is the only way to actually achieve something, and that goes through cutting away the \"translators\"",

Freakanomics did a good podcast on this comparing Republicans and Democrats to Coca Cola  and Pepsi being duopolies that don\u2019t want to destroy each other as much as they want to remain the two primary choices.  The same applies even more so to politics.  Ranked choice would give us more options and allow the people to really rank who they like best.  Problem is neither the dems or republicans will likely get behind this as it hurts both parties so hard to get this to happen.  Some places like Alaska are experimenting with it though.   \n\nhttps://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-dont-we-have-better-candidates-for-president/",

                    "commentBody": "I am a leftist (not a Democrat, they're cowards) and I can tell you why you cannot fix the divide between us. I am not trolling, I am giving you an honest answer:\n\nYou do not believe in universal human rights. You simply don't. It doesn't matter how you feel about that statement, conservatives don't support universal healthcare, don't support immigration, don't support trans people's rights to live their own life. I understand that you don't want to have to tell people your pronouns because you think it's stupid. Okay. That's not the issue. The issue is you literally pass laws preventing trans people from having the surgery that affirms their gender, even as adults. You want to control how everyone lives. This is fundamentally against what we believe.\n\nYou guys have a right to your beliefs, absolutely. I understand this. But you have to understand that if your beliefs fundamentally affect the safety of my family members, then I am not interested in hearing how \"it's just politics let's talk football instead.\" That's not how this works. It's not 1995 and the main difference between our parties is tax dollars and how we apply them. There are serious real world differences in what we believe and I don't think conservatives will be rational about the fact that if you keep trying to legislate the lives of everyone, it will come back to bite you.\n\nI see a lot of people saying like \"why can't we talk about football and not politics???\" What conservatives fail to understand about leftists today is that to us, EVERYTHING is political. Our way of life is completely under attack. You won all three branches. Congratulations! A lot of the country agrees with you. But when you then choose to try to erase every single thing leftists want...why would we ever want to come together with you? The problem is not that you don't want to live how we want to live, it's that you don't want to let us live how we want to live. You all want to turn every single state into Texas and Oklahoma and you can't comprehend why other people might not be interested in that.\n\nYou can disagree with me on how best to apply a tax code. You can disagree with me on free market regulations and how we apply governmental intervention. These are valid things to disagree on. But you can't tell me that trans people don't have the right to live and expect me to hear you. You can't tell me that you love tacos and then tell me you want to deport every brown person you see. You can't tell me that you love everyone because of Jesus but that gays kissing in Disney movies makes you want to shoot me. You cannot comprehend that the world is not ONLY yours, and yet you treat it that way.\n\nThe thing is: I can name several conservative policies I have agreed with, because I am a rational person. But I expect this post to fall on deaf ears. All you have to do is conservatives is let other people live their own life. But you can't do it. you have to be the main character of everyone's life. Your way goes, and that's it, because of the American flag...or something.\n\nI don't give a shit what you do on your free time. But unfortunately for all of you, you can't stop obsessing over how we spend our free time. And that's where the breakdown lies. This divide will never end. There's no room for compromise or being wrong in conservative philosophy.\n\nSo we will just have to continue to hate each other.",

And it's not just for me; it's for my elderly parents. It's scary to hear of people being turned back at Customs because they texted uncomplimentary things about Trump to their friends. I'm worried about the rice and sugar farmers in my neck of the woods going bankrupt and corporations buying up their farms. I'm totally unsure of what is going to happen with cancer research, food safety, airline safety, and institutional memory with all these people being indiscriminately fired from the government just to save 2% of the federal budget. It really concerns me that the contributions of African-Americans, women, Native Americans, etc. are being scrubbed from government web sites because they might demonstrate that ours is a diverse and inclusive country. I'm especially concerned that suddenly being a diverse and inclusive country with a promise of equality for all is a bad thing (or a thing to not even be spoken about our thought about). It's not the country I grew up in (with liberty and justice for all, you know). My heart is breaking every day.",

I've heard enough from leftists to know many want some form that approaches communism, at least the ones I see on social media, I understand many just want socialist programs not full on socialism in every area (I still think that is stupid - and that is coming from a Canadian). We can't heal a divide between us a commies. \n\nLikewise, in their eyes, they see us as fascist (wrongly).  So they see the same unconquerable divide. We can argue with these types until doomsday, it won't make a difference. The best thing to do, is immediately disregard them when they get disrespectful, and applaud them when the respectfully and in good faith engage. \n\nOur media also needs to stop trying to own all these idiots. Destiny should not have a career, and wouldn't even be a footnote in politics if Conservatives didn't keep platforming the idiot. Same with Hasan Piker, and other breadtubers. If someone engages in good faith, engage back. \n\nIdentify strawmen, ad homin attacks, and other cheap tactics, call them out and don't engage. Identify rage bait, block and move on. Don't fuel the social media engagement of bad actors.",

There is a tendency for people to shout nazi online in cases it\u2019s not especially appropriate or true, but to ignore the parallels between 1930s nazi germany and the current day trump administration is to ignore history and reason. I can understand certain aspects such as opposition to abortions even if I personally disagree, but as those who claim to champion free speech, the people you\u2019ve supported seem to be the most hell bent on banning books and terms in scientific literature I\u2019ve ever seen. This may come off as harsh, but please, genuinely I mean well. I believe that you do believe in free speech and all the things you say, but your actions do not follow suit, and I do not blame you for that. But the hypocrisy exhibited by the Republican Party and conservative media is comedic at times. Crying free speech one second only to ban the term \u201cwomen\u201d in all scientific literature the next. Do you not see how this pushes a strong divide between us. \nThe left from their perspective has spent the last 10 years trying to tell you of this hypocrisy and warn of it, only to fall on deaf ears. As a result they have lost their patience and upon seeing the dismantling of the government that Elon and trump have spearheaded are going more and more extreme because to me and to them, the line was crossed long ago. Trump is dismantling our democracy, restricting your freedoms and shooting the lower/middle classes jn the foot, raising the rich to heights even more unequal than even the French Revolution.\nAnd the worst thing is the right for whatever reason can not see it. I could go on and on, but at the end of the day, the reason for hostility from the left is that the right simply will not listen nor abide by what used to be agreed upon conventions or truths like \u201ctheocracy is bad\u201d or \u201cthe church and state should be seperate\u201d. Even science is now a political issue, climate change, conservation, any form of environmental sciences are all \u201cwoke\u201d now and seemingly ignored out of spite. If you want the hostility to stop, the rampant anti-intellectualism, the rampant discrimination against minorities with the cover of \u201cdei\u201d and the sticking of one\u2019s fingers in their ears and going lalalala has to stop",

It's very hard to find common ground with people that are emotional. \n\nThey are afraid, they are outraged, they are willing to pretend they accept every weird or inappropriate thing. They're being peer pressured into agreement because they can't imagine being attacked by the mob and being called a bigot or something.  So they fall into the echo chamber that believes Trump is litterally Hitler and all that. There is unfortunately no way to reason with people like that. We just need to continue to appeal to normal people and in time the radical perpetually outraged left will be a distant memory. I hope",

The true \"Left\" is a fraction of a fraction of the population, and most of the power they wield is because they have dominated the institutions for decades. \n\nYou will never convince \"true believer\" Leftists of anything. That assumes they're motivated by social cohesion and truth and those are the antithesis of the very project they are supporters of. \n\nThose people (again, a fraction of a fraction of the population) are to be marginalized and removed from positions of authority.

Every once in a while I can't help checking this sub because I want to understand what conservatives are seeing - given what *I'm* seeing. I'm not American, but the left vs right discourse is spreading everywhere. The fact that normal people would have such hatred for each other doesn't make sense to me. I recently watched a podcast that probably wouldn't be palatable for most here, as it's Jon Stewart, but it was his interview with Maria Ressa where they talk about how hatred and negativety spread and go viral more easily than nuance, than positive content. This means that social media, the algorithms etc are incentivized to spread hate, and this leads to people not living in the same \"reality\", not agreeing to the same set of facts.\n\nIt's profit and click driven, but it's causing the break down of society as a by-product. If about 50% of people disagree with each other even on what are the facts, if they then elect representatives commited to doing the same - there is no way you could possibly move forward, build society, solve any problem. You would always be fighting each other. Everything would get worse as a result of the tug of war, and the lack of progress would be just blamed on each other.",

                    "commentBody": "I agree with the sentiment here.  I am a moderate democratic leaning (but who has voted for republicans if I agree with them, mostly at the state level) living in a liberal area.  I really wish we could have more constructive dialogue rather than just name calling.  \n\nWhat I will say is people are scared and for legitimate reasons.  Specifically the expansion of presidential power that Trump is exercising.  Obama expanded executive power too, and that was not good.  Trump is pushing things even further. I am sincerely concerned about the erosion of democracy.  \n\nThere are things I might agree with conservatives on but not the way they are being executed.  I also believe the government is bloated.  I also believe we should make cuts and address inefficiencies.  The problem I see is the way it\u2019s being done with DOGE just cutting without any oversight.  I love the outdoors, as do many conservatives I know.  I don\u2019t think either liberals or conservatives really want to see our national parks and national forests destroyed or sold.   Similarly, cancer does not care who you voted for.  Do we really want to be drastically cutting our budget for medical research?  I\u2019m in biotech myself and am legitimately scared because I see china heavily investing in things like synthetic biology and genomics and fear these cuts will end up hurting our economy because almost all the innovative research happens in academic research institutes funded by the NIH and is then licensed by startups or companies to develop new treatments.  The government also historically funds SBIR (small business innovation research) grants that help people start new innovative biotech companies that fuel growth in our domestic economy.  Cutting these things hurts us and helps China.  I think most conservatives I know don\u2019t want China to beat the US economically but I feel policies like this will do that.  Perhaps we can have topics on conversations like these.  \n\nOn the flip side there are things the far left does that I think poisons the democratic pot.  For example, most people think that it is unfair to have trans women compete in women\u2019s sports.  As a biologist it is hard for me to understand why people are so willing to deny the role testosterone plays in development.  I wish democrats would give up on this issue which impacts a fraction of a percent of the small population that is trans and also wants to compete in athletics. If you poll people most Americans find this unfair.  I really wish we could have more discussions on compromise on issues rather than blindly agreeing with everything \u201cour side\u201d does. \n\nOne thing I\u2019d like to understand from the conservative side is why people are so angry about George Soros but not scared about the power Elon Musk is openly exercising in this administration.  If you don\u2019t want billionaires to manipulate our government, shouldn\u2019t this apply to Musk as well who is even wealthier than Soros?  Shouldn\u2019t we all mutually want unelected billionaires to not flex power in government?  Perhaps this is something we could unite on.  \n\nThank you for opening this dialogue.",

In other words one side or the other will need major wins for a sustained period of time. The views on how to fix the economy and views on foreign policy are polar opposites. One side will have to prove more correct than the other across the board to the extent it weakens the other side\u2019s credibility. This would have the effect bolstering a majority which aligns to policies which actually fix the most divisive issues.If Trump\u2019s policies are successful then I predict a shift toward the Conservative Party. If they aren\u2019t successful, or if Democrats derail the efforts then the division continues and likely results in another shift in power come next election. Time will tell.",

Heck, your post feels incredibly fake when you call the US left that \"*they're douche bags*\", accusing \"conservatives\" as Nazis, and more importantly; \"*how to get the left out of their crazy bullshit*\". Then ending with \"*we need to be the mature people here, which we are*\".\n\nYou want to talk with the left? Maybe stop treating them like babies/not human, and respect their opinions as opinions, and not just \"*crazy bullshit*\", as you say. \n\nI respect conservatives, **especially outside** the US. I'm somewhat right-leaning, myself. Heck, I get proud seeing some of the Conservatives on here that actually critique their own side, and understand that some points aren't actually driven by **real** Conservatives, but just hate and non-relevant. \n\nIt's no longer \"*I think Christianity is important*\", but \"*we should think less of other religions.*\"  \nIt's not \"*I don't believe in trans/we should be careful of it*\", it's \"*trans doesn't exist, and if they do, let's find ways to remove them.*\"  \nIt's not \"*immigration can be dangerous, and the ones that comes in illegally needs to be checked for criminality*\", but now it's \"***all*** *immigrants should be deported immediately from the US, end of story.*\" \n\nThere's no understanding because there's no want for it.",

We need to return to elementary school kids saying the pledge of allegiance, and making it okay to do so.  Respecting our founding fathers instead of tearing them down, and teaching the good along with the problematic.\nHigh school students should have to take a class on the Constitution, and why it\u2019s so vital to this country\u2019s history and future.  Moreover, it should be taught by someone who isn\u2019t an ideologue- a teacher that isn\u2019t beholden to a political party or agenda.\nCollege professors are probably the worst offenders of pushing their dogma on students.  These people are steeped so deeply in academia, they haven\u2019t been in the real world in a very long time, and because they have tenure, they can teach whatever and however they damn well please.  It seems to me that college is where most of the liberal mindset is sculpted - these impressionable teens fresh out of high school are subjected to radical ideology by professors whom the students are supposed to look upon with respect and admiration.\nUntil we start placing more emphasis on trade skills, engineering, and technology and less on college degrees with no practical application (gender studies), we\u2019re going to have a hell of a time getting students to graduate with a rational mindset.",

He spoke on how MSM has become Greema Worm-Tongue pissing poison in the ears of people(the way he did to the king), And it's dead ass on point in America. Leaving us(mostly the left) broken, Sick, And our country dying from it. This sickness is consuming so many, And it saddens me. Something has to be done about MSM propaganda bc that is what's causing this without question. We're all just gonna have to find the best way to rid ourselves of them without 1A violations that would be terrible on us.",

There's a lot of ostensibly conservative policy that I'm all for, and the left very frequently gets on some bullshit.\n\nI think the real problem isn't that we disagree and hate each other, it's that people serve to make a lot of money off of this partisan divide, and it makes it a lot easier for politicians to get people out and voting for them.\n\nWe've got to get money out of politics and the media, it's a form of corruption. We've all got a right to know the truth. The problem is that truth has gotten political, and so if anybody tries to say what the truth is they're inherently biased. Sometimes I really don't know who to trust, everybody's got an agenda or an influencer in their ear.\n\nI honestly don't know the solution. It's a conundrum. What I will say is that I don't hate you guys, and I'll bet you don't hate me. I think that if we respect each other, we'll get closer to a solution.",

However, on the other hand, maybe 1 in 5 of those civilians I've worked with were shitbags who barely worked, took advantage of every opportunity to their benefit, and abused the fact that it's REMARKABLY difficult to fire federal employees to continue to barely do anything. Frankly, I think I'd just like to see an overhaul of the federal employee guidance and make it easier to be able to fire GS employees, which would allow the leaders on the ground more control over situations with their own employees.",

If someone else forged his signature, it was, and still is, up to him to state that.  If he makes no such claim, then he accepts them as his own orders.\n\n&gt;But he was senile\n\nHe was the president.  He still had all the powers of the president.  The 25th amendment provides a mechanism for removing those powers should he become incapable of executing his duties.  If he was senile, it was up to Harris and the cabinet to act.

A noticeable cognitive decline is evident for you over the years. A bunch of checks with your stamped signature start getting submitted but when questioned you don't specifically remember signing them... Yet they are processed anyways.  Since your memory is already questionable, and medically declared faulty enough (incompetent) for you not to stand trial if needed, nobody can claim that you indeed intentionally signed/stamped them. Nobody can verify it either way, therefore they are all void by default. Yet you technically maintain 100% authority as the owner of the account. Should those payments still be processed, including the ones you honestly couldn't attest to signing/stamping? \n\nI understand the 25th amendment and all, but these issues weren't really identified until after it was too late to address them via those means. \n\nAgain, I see where you are coming from on this matter. I also see it as a slippery slope to navigate, I just don't think the auto pen signatures should just be blindly accepted simply because \"authority as president\".... \n\nIf Trump had the IQ of a potato and everything was being signed via auto pen I'd be questioning the validity of those as well.",

OP is essentially saying that because there are mechanism in place to remove an incompetent president, that would have happened if he was truly incompetent.  \n\nBut what if he was incompetent, and they did not remove him?  I think that's where we are at.  \n\nRobert Hur said that Biden would \"present to a jury as as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"  How do we contend with this information?  It's not decisive by any means, but it's not to be ignored either.",

The challenge here would be whether the President was incapacitated when the autopen was used so that approval could not have been given to others. There are other challenges that could be raised to the validity of those pardons and orders, but this one is the one I find most likely to be what has taken place. Biden's handlers- which we now know he had- may very well have taken it upon themselves to autosign documents on his behalf that Biden knew or understood nothing about. This also assumes that a President's \"auto- signature\"  can even be accepted as the equivalent of an original signature on executive orders, which it may very well not be. That is a question for SCOTUS to take up.",

The executive's authority is only his to use and for others to put things before him he didn't know, there's no authority being exercised.  it's intentional abuse of authority that renders it void. Biden's not king or a god and isn't untouchable and 25th amendment is one way to deal with this. Questioning him under oath is another. We can now do that to presidents we've seen it so let's get Joe on the record. There's nothing to say we can't do that. And left broke precedent so let's go",

Yet that pardon was slipped in along with thousands of others. Many pardons go back to specific odd years, which is even more suspicious. \n\nI know this sub is being taken over by new \"fellow conservatives,\" but it's definitely logical to question many of Bidens' EO's.

The two cannot be treated the same because they aren't the same. A handwritten signature carries proof the president signed it. Autopen does not. Yet you think we should treat these as the same? That is absurd. Just ceding more power to the deep state as usual. Some great conservative you are.",

Contracts can be invalidated if a party is deemed to lack the mental capacity to consent. Why should presidential orders be exempt from this scrutiny, especially given their impact?\n\nWhat if Biden had auto-penned an order to move nuclear weapons into Ukraine?  I don't know that a president can do that on their own, but you get the point.  It would have been disastrous.\n\nIn this specific case of the pardons, the question is likely moot. It would have to be proven that Biden was senile when the EO was signed, and how do you do that now?",

EACH autosignature must have some documentation of this type or it is not legally binding.\n\nthe reason for this is EXACTLY why we are having this discussion.

Sure. The Sagan standard of \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" applies. \n\nBut if it's a blanket \"autopen signature are valid\" all you need is someone to sneak in and put the president's John Hancock on anything and sure it's legal, the \"president\" signed it! I think it's worth the investigation.",

He was president with all his powers and faculties or he wasn't.  \n\nThe left is currently saying Trump is senile. Will he also get this same benefit of being in a superposition of both liable for nothing yet still all powerful?",

The constitution provides a mechanism of removing the president for being incapable.  If he wasn\u2019t removed, he maintains alls of his authority.\n\nBut let\u2019s just follow this logic for a minute.  Let\u2019s assume that he was incapable (I actually do believe he was senile).  What was supposed to happen?  Well, Harris and the cabinet were supposed to remove him, and she was supposed to become president.  \n\nWith her becoming president, she would have the authority to issue pardons.  She would also have had the ability to stop his \u201chandlers\u201d if those handlers were someone other than herself\n\nBut Harris and the cabinet opted not to take this action.  That is their explicit endorsement of all actions taken by Biden (either on his own or via his handlers on his behalf).\n\nSo if the person who was president doesn\u2019t object, and the person you argue \u201cshould have\u201d been president doesn\u2019t object, there is no grounds to vacate the orders.",

He should be quizzed on other important documents he signed to assure the public that he was aware and approved.\n\nBut the fact he couldn't personally sign his own son's pardon leaves us to wonder if he was that lazy? There should be a reason to use an auto-pen... Biden should answer why he didn't sign things.\n\nI imagine the answer is something like, 'signing things was just an administrative task delegate to his team'. And if that's the answer, this only fuels the conspiracy that Biden wasn't running the nation. If he delegating signing, did he delegate approving?",

The pardons were signed by autopen and Biden was not the person using the autopen (I.e neera tanden)\n\nAnd\n\n2. No written authorization for her to do this existed , actually signed by Biden and verified to have existed prior to the pardon date. This would be a letter saying something as simple as \u201cplease use autopen to sign this truckload of pardons for me\u201d.\n\nIf those two things are both true, it would mean that any person with access to the autopen could pardon any monster they wanted without having to bother with being the actual president.\n\nIn those cases, it not only should be reversed, but the autopen wielder should be charged with treason.\n\nThis ever shifting landscape, where the left can do whatever it wants outside of all established norms and we on the right just have to suck it up and accept the new (often temporary) normal, must end. \n\nIt is insane that we had an incapacitated president and no one on the left cared\n\nIt\u2019s insane that the left engages in violence and intimidation and their leader are silent. \n\nIt\u2019s insane that lawfare was and is being used against our president \n\nIt is insane that activist judges are blocking the presidents agenda simply out of political spite.\n\nWe have to reject this madness",

                    "commentBody": "This is a pretty absurd post. I hope all the likes are leftist brigade.\n\nAutopen should NEVER have been an option for things that are of the utmost importance. Maybe for paperwork that's procedural or something like that but 100% NOT on any legislation, treaties, Pardons, or anything that has serious implications for that matter bc the possibility of forgery. \n\nA President couldn't say he didn't sign a document that he wasn't aware of, Then died or became incapacitated so that arguement is a joke. What if he found out after the fact, And was blackmailed to stay quiet? There's too much risk in allowing for this, These are some of the only documents that I would feel this way about bc this is the tip top of our government, And the most sensitive documents therefore they're few in number so there's no legitimate reason to use anything but his hand.\n\nBiden's case was unique bc his clear mental decline, His last possible term, As well as his inability to stand trial for any heinous things they might do in his name. As we clearly saw, He broke the law with the classified docs case, But they declined prosecution bc his mental state. They knew people would likely not convict him, And that gives cover for anything they might wanna do like pardoning terrible people outside his family on heinous crimes, His entire family given blanket immunity for crimes they committed to enrich him/themselves or even fkn murder bc it's so broadly written, And anything else they could dream up.\n\n Your argument about his cabinet is a joke bc it hinges on people with integrity rather than power hungry vultures that saw a unique opportunity. The 25th amendment wouldn't be invoked by people who want all the power of the Presidency, And none of the blame for the terrible things done in his name. You have to keep in mind that this isn't just about Biden, Its also about future Presidents that could have far worse happen even than in his case.\n\nThe fact that you would accept ANYONE else signing a document for him as long as he doesn't dispute it is fkn alarming, Better yet it insane. That is an unacceptable premise, That leaves the door open for any Presidential documents to be disputed later, And we cannot have that shit happening. Especially those of severe consequence.\n\nThis has too much potential for being abused, Causing chaos/insanity, And general undermining of Presidential authority. It must not be accepted. \n\nI said that Hunter should never have been charged for the things he went to court on. The claim of lying on a form based on something that wasn't a constitutional question to start with is bogus. Now, That said, There should be no world in which he could be pardoned for ANY crime he committed during a period of time yet here we are now. Left with accepting that he could've done horrible shit to our country and will never be held accountable or we challenge presidential pardon power which could actually be legitimately needed in the future. As we saw with the psychotic cases against Trump, Where they broke every rule/standard meant to prevent such a prosecution all bc they hate the man, When you have insane zealots bent on putting you in prison you might need a pardon to keep them from illegally imprisoning you til you die!\n\nI cannot see how any conservative could possibly think this is ok. \n\nI might accept that he get a chance to sign his pardons for his family over again in his own hand. As much as I really don't like it, For the good of the country i could see making that exception(As long as it doesn't cover treason/Rape/Murder or other truly heinous crimes), But not on Fauci, J6 commitee, or any others done in the last bit of his Presidency. If they were autopen then they're fair game to scrutinize.\n\nThen we get a ruling that says \"No more on certain documents\" which would be clearly defined in the ruling, And it never happens again. This issue is too dangerous to be allowed to continue as is.",

Faucci is negligentl g responsible for millions of deaths, this is crimes against humanity level shit and he needs to stand trial for it.

But we should void all autopen signatures in the future. If the President can't take the time to actually sign an EO or pardon, then it should hold no weight. If it's important enough for the President to want to enact it through executive fiat, then the President should be able to take the dang 3 seconds to sign it.",

It's the fact the autopen opens up the possibility of other people besides the president authorizing a signature. If the chief of staff authorizes a signature, that's not a valid signature. Only the president can authorize the use of the autopen to replace his signature. And because Biden is senile, there's a lot of question as to whether or not he did that. Look at the conversation he had with Mike Johnson about cutting off natural gas exports. He had no idea that he had authorized that, and yet his signature was on the order. I imagine somebody used the auto pen to fake biden's signature, and that's the problem",

A lot to like about her but still needs to deliver.  \n\nBut I actually envision a scenario where Trump may resign in the 4th year due to health problems (hopefully not but at 81... ). But if something were to emerge,  he would never pull Biden. Trump would make decision that is best for America: if he can't give 100% he will step down for good of Americans \n\nWe may actually see President JD running in an election and for 8 years in office.",

Bush seemed invisible in the Reagan years; the media basically destroyed Dan Quayle; Al Gore was only lightly used, mostly because every time he opened his mouth in public, he came off as a fool.  Dick Cheney was kept in the background mostly, though I'm sure he was a major player behind the scenes.  Joe Biden was literally a low-level walking nightmare that could have sent the Obama ship to the bottom.  Mike Pence was used sparingly, probably because he wasn't really on board with the MAGA movement.  And Kamala Harris was legitimately the worst VP since Henry Wallace.\n\nJD Vance, on the other hand, seems to be out front, used publicly by the administration, and seems to revel in the attention of being mostly a spokesman and cheerleader for the president.  I think tht bodes really well for him.  He's already been a Senator, he'll still be relatively youthful in 2028, he'll *probably* have the backing of President Trump, and his name recognition will beone of the highest of any politician not named Trump.\n\nI look forward to seeing him running for president, and I think he's going to be a really good one.",

I brought up the significantly greater plummet the Dow had in 2022, and instead of responding to me in the thread, he goes to DM me. Turned out like this...\n\nHe (I can't tag his name because he blocked me) literally messaged me \"Apparently going against king trump is means for banning on this sub Reddit, very freedom minded isn\u2019t it? So unfortunately I won\u2019t be able to respond to your MAGAT kool aid drinking comment\"\n\nI called him out on how miserable and insufferable he is and listed WHY r/Conservative limits the opposing statements, because you can literally go EVERYWHERE ELSE on reddit to get overwhelmed by leftists. I've literally questioned and criticized things Trump has done, pointed it out to him, and he responds this \"Wow you criticized your king that changes everything blocked.\"\n\nSeriously. Left or right, it doesn't matter. When you have one person acting like a literal toddler, slinging childish insults and comments, then resorting to blocking people that call you out for your BS because you can't engage in an intellectually honest conversation; that won't get anybody over to your side. That's why the Democrats will lose next term as well unless they seriously take a step back, reflect, and grow the hell up. I guarantee he will tell all his buddies that I \"insulted\" him and was just spewing propaganda, which I was not at all. He's not the first example I've seen of this either, personally.",

If they don't achieve this, they meltdown, and resort to Bolshevik-esque violence.",

What he was saying is that the connections this has to older and also later events will be shocking to us. It's hard to say what that means, but I wonder if there is some kind of weird nazi connection. One theory I also heard was that Bush Senior was somehow involved.\n\nI don't know. I just hope Trump announcing today it doesn't backfire tomorrow if something doesn't happen.",

I would agree that Satanism is by far the more popular religion among Democrats though, although more of the edgy atheist type than LaVeyan",

I have been messaged privately sometimes by people that lurk in the far left pagan spheres that I am no longer welcome in saying they are conservative, centrist, etc. but cannot voice their thoughts without fear of being ostracized.\n\nCommunity is important to people, and many people will pick a religious community over a political one. It very well could be a silent majority at this point that just thinks that everyone else is either far left or far right and so just keep quiet, though I do doubt it is that sizable.\n\nEnd of the day, however, is that it is a greater number than probably anyone actually expects because if you are vocal about being a pagan on the political right, even just barely vocal, you are ostracized by many pagan spaces and demonized by many right wing spaces. Most people just choose to be silent.",

His father picked him up over his head while everyone was cheering (except Dems) and crying, then the kid gave Sean Curran (director of USSS) a giant bear hug. It was a very touching moment and maybe the best part of Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nDems sat on their hands and looked glum because they are monsters who care about nothing except being in power, and they are very upset about not being in power right now.",

They\u2019re a bunch of six-year-olds who have no leadership and no insight. There are co-celebratory issues that they could\u2019ve clapped for, but in their insolence and ignorance, they chose to sit on their hands and read their phones. It was disgusting display. A display of a party that is incapable of running this great nation. God bless Trump and God bless America.",

I still think he could be great for Ohio, they could use a technology/modern infusion into their state. When I went there, it felt like old country and wasn't very exciting. I think he has a vision where it becomes another silicon valley, that could be awesome for Ohio.",

There's no way it's a 51st state thing, that's just trolling and we don't need another liberal state to tip power in Washington. He said it's for border security, well, they are increasing their border security and the Northern border isn't nearly the problem the Southern border is. I struggle to see what the end goal is. He's hurting conservatives in Canada who would have had a slam dunk election just a few months ago. A new pipeline would have been easy with Canadian and American conservatives working together...He's hurting consumers here... I can't figure this one out.",

He had a Republican majority back then too, but it was not MAGA and was led by Paul Ryan and McConnell. Now he just has a bunch of bootlickers and shit is flying off the rails.",

Having to depend on imports is not good for national security in the event of a global war.  We need to be able to produce our own steel and lumber and other things in quantities sufficient to support that.",

Not Canada as a whole, as a state, but more like either the individual provinces get assimilated as individual states (the states of Alberta, Ontario, etc), **OR** Canada retains its autonomy, more or less, and becomes a US territory like Puerto Rico. The same or similar goes for the talk around acquiring Greenland.\n\nAs for the why, I think that:  \n(a) Trump or someone higher up (because honestly I wouldn't be surprised at this point if we had an AI advisor) believes that we may be entering an era of resource warfare. Water, minerals, arable farmland, etc.  \n(b) With climate change and the thawing of Arctic region, basically a new region of the planet is unlocking before our eyes which could dramatically upend established trade routes through Panama. Its not just about the Northwest Passage/Arctic Ocean/Beaufort Sea, though, but also the undeveloped land that stretches throughout Alaska (which the US already owns), Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Nunavut, and Greenland. That is, land which has not seen any sizeable human settlement such as what's seen in warmer climates.\n\nIF global temperatures are rising and polar ice is melting, the upside to this is that land which was previously deemed impassible by land or sea is now becoming passable. Its effectively like having the \"fog of war\" clear from a Age of Empires II map before our eyes.\n\n[This is the area that's ultimately in play](https://imgur.com/a/0itRFmZ). Russia already controls a large portion of it. Greenland is in prime position to have a large impact, but sparsely populated. Canada is similar, and is arguably a sociopolitical mess from the policies of the past several years.\n\nJust my $.02 anyways. The pull on Canada and Greenland are so seemingly random, and with Trump's recent push for minerals and rare earth deals, this is the best I can rationalize.",

Then minus at least 100b in direct and indirect corporate activities via subs. In other words we actually have a surplus with Canada and trade licenses for big tech, pharma products, and entertainment like Netflix and game pass  (which don\u2019t show up on surplus usually) for maple syrup, oil and timber. Sounds like a good deal to me. I\u2019d rather have maple syrup than Microsoft 365 and I don\u2019t even have to give up Microsoft 365 to get it as that can be made infinitely at little extra cost.",

There are countries that supply mainly goods, physical goods, and there are other things like services that other countries provide, and the United States gets a lot of money from providing services. To talk about one part of the trading and ignore the other part fails to understand that money is money no matter whether it\u2019s from goods or services.\n\n&gt;When you set off a trade war, like any other war, you have no idea how that\u2019s going to end. You\u2019re going to be blindsided by all kinds of consequences. You do not make America great again by raising the price to Americans, which is what a tariff does.",

(mainly because of inflation and excessive government spending under Biden)\n\nThis means the market is sitting on a giant bubble and is due for a *hard* correction and Buffet was getting ahead of the impending crash by holding a bunch of cash.\u00a0\n\nTrump may have made the problem worse and accelerated the crash with the tariff BS, but a big market correction was inevitable anyway.",

We need to fix the employment market, we have too many low skilled workers and not enough low skill jobs. The lack of employer competition has lead to stagnating wages. Deregulation, lower fines, fees and taxes for small businesses unless they are doing something dangerous of course. More companies more competition, better prices and wages and more opportunities.",

This really puts the squeeze on people in the middle when they\u2019re competing with people that don\u2019t work very much or don\u2019t work at all for the same good and services. There\u2019s a reason why grocery stores are so adamantly against SNAP reform. Because it would drive prices lower with the decrease in artificial demand. So by capping interest, what are the people in the middle going to do when they\u2019re competing need another $50 or $100 bucks to stretch until payday? Payday loans? Every economic thing the government touches turns to shit, especially if AOC, Lieawatha, or Bernie Sanders are involved.",

If interest on a credit card, which is essentially an unsecured line of credit, is capped at 10%, banks will only give credit to the most qualified of people. If that's the case then that will be good for people because they will be forced to only buy what they can afford with cash. However, I believe that credit card companies will get around that by instead of offering \"unsecured\" credit, they will only offer it if you have something as collateral. House, car or other liquid assets which they will then come after if you miss payments. Im sure even AOC can figure out the long term effects on that when poor people continue to rack up credit card debt and the bank starts coming for the few items they actually own.",

He talked about misguided government banning them, but pointed out the effect was poor people still needed loans, so they went to dangerous loan sharks instead.  \n\nThat part of the book struck me because he presented it as a turning point in politics for him, that the government could legit want what's best for you but still screw it up.  And the market will always adjust to whatever kind of regulation.  \n\nEven a more \"reasonable\" bill of capping interest at prime + 10% or something would still have negative knock on affects",

Which do you think is more harmful to people, capping credit card interest rates, or taxing foreign goods at an additional 25%? Both obviously have upsides and downsides, but the question is if those benefits outweigh the cost. \n\nA fairly predictable outcome of the bill would be reduced access to credit, with more denials. This would be good financially speaking for a lot of people, even if it caused short term economic hardship. There could be more impacts, but do you think allowing 35% interest rates on credit cards for the poor is really helping them? The average rate right now is around 27%, with people in worse economic situations being the ones far exceeding the average.",

They'll have to go to black market loan sharks or some other workaround like secured CCs or high rate personal loans instead. This seems like the first step to government backed credit cards for poor people.",

I'm not a fan of \"Nanny State\" laws that essentially say people are too stupid for their own good so government must interfere. I'd be okay with something like a tobacco warning label that says this costs you 30% more if you don't pay it off in 30 days or something along those lines.  Call it Transparency in Interest Rates Acts or something. Companies will then charge 10% interest and have other fees to make up for it and people that pay on time will end up fitting the bill to subsidize those that don't.",

All a 10% cap would do is eliminate credit options for about half the market.\n\nWhen I was younger I used two credit cards to finance the improvements for my first rental property.  If credit was tight I probably would have found another way, but it would have cost more and taken longer.  Now I own a portfolio of properties and have lots of people wanting to lend me money.  \n\nCredit is just a tool and it\u2019s up to you to use that tool wisely.",

Banks will cancel credit cards for existing customers. \n\nI actually agree with this bill to a degree.... 10% seems ridiculous,  but lowering maximum to 20? Something to think about",

Is it because rates will be lower or because 90% of Americans will no longer be able to have a credit card?\n\nPersonally I think it is a good thing that basically no one will have a credit card and spending money they do not have. That is 100% the outcome of this.\n\nIt sounds great an paper, lower interest rates for all. Since it is unsecured credit people that may potentially default will just never be eligible meaning they now have to go to even worse payday loan scams or illegal loan sharks when they are in need.",

Not entirely their fault, society is all about getting the good stuff *now* and complaining about the consequences later. People have (to my estimation) lost their ability to live within their means and now they live within their shufflable debt. Is that the government's responsibility to address? We may agree to disagree on that.\n\nIt's not so much the limitation of the 10% interest charges that I'm smiling about, it's the unintentional (I'm sure to AOC) effect that by necessity credit card companies will drop everyone's credit limit from tens of thousands to single thousands (or less) that they actually would be able to afford. \n\nI'm not a total free market person, there are some regulations that I think are good. If we had the right regulations about sub-prime mortgages, traunches and CDOs (and especially synthetic CDOs) back in the 2000s maybe we could have avoided the disaster of the housing market collapse. Again is it really the government's responsibility? We will probably have to agree to disagree.",

If the government came accept that then this probably would make us a healthier society (mentally anyway, not having a mountain a debt is less rewssful than having 1)\n\n\nBut I think we all know that when the reality of this bill hits the \"show humanity\" campaign will pop up and force credit card companies to expand who they are will to give cards to which will create all sorts of problems.\n\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what happens from here",

However as a person who grew up in a family of four with two working poor parents, \u201cliving beyond your means\u201d sometimes meant the refrigerator died and they don\u2019t have money to buy a new one. \n\nThey didn\u2019t even have a credit card of their own, they used my grandma\u2019s Sears credit card to buy a new refrigerator, the interest rate at the time on a Sears card hovered around 22% and my parents paid down the principal for much more than a decade. Forget the money. The stress and turmoil it caused in our family was immense. For an appliance. \n\nSo yeah, while I\u2019m libertarian I\u2019m for some kind of restraint against predatory lending.

The most likely is that lower income people will have a harder time getting credit cards.  Which is actually a good thing because apparently most Americans now a days think its the government's job to keep them from making poor financial decisions because the internet doesn't exist and they can't do basic research (eg student loans for garbage degrees).\n\nSo hopefully this dovetails into the fed getting out of the business of subsidizing/ensuring student loans and then the market prices dumb people out of bad degrees.

Every little thing Trump says or doesn't say will somehow lead to World War 3, the collapse of the dollar and the collapse of America and only democrats, yes those same dems that just got their asses handed to them, can save us!\n\nSomeone posted a blue \"Is he dead yet\" hat on some sub, and countless weirdos were quite excited about it, and we all know what they were talking about.  Most of us were not fans of Biden/Harris or the dems, but we don't want anyone to die.  We just wanted to beat them at the polls.  Apparently, that's not how many democrats feel about our side.\n\nIt seems that the left have lost their collective minds, particularly so here on Reddit.\n\nP.S. Today is the day that butthurt leftists are boycotting Amazon, so if you need anything from AMZN, it's a good day to shop there, imo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggews7m4icne1.jpg?width=1011&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f555295abe87fcc6cc67c34a851cdbd6d3ff4eec",

Trump won like 89% of the counties in this last election, but when you break it down by the numbers, he barely got the popular vote. Some may want you to believe that liberalism is dying, but I assure you it's not. As I said, the popular vote was very close and that's saying something considering how far left the party has shifted already. Almost half the country voted for that.",

All of the lies the Democrats and legacy media poured into trying to win were exposed in their loss, and the events that followed. I know some liberals, and they really believed Trump was going to jail prior to the vote. They refused to believe they were just trumped-up charges for the sake of interference. When Trump won such a commanding victory and that illusion began to fade away, they finally started to question the BS they were fed, as they should have in the first place.\n\nMy sister, a donor, was one of those people. She finally acknowledged that the wool had been pulled over her eyes, and all they were after was her money. I know she wasn't alone, either, and the ludicrous behavior of the Democrats since after hasn't done them any favors. These people are far more skeptical now of the legacy media, too, and turning to more modern sources. Support for DOGE has surged over 50% and the President's recent address to Congress earned a 76% approval rating from viewers, all while Democrats have hit a 30-year low in favorability, hovering around 30%. They're ejecting the more moderate/centrist element at an alarming rate.\n\nModern American liberalism has suffered a critical blow, but instead of reflecting on their mistakes and working to regain credibility, they're doubling down on their failed approach, further alienating those outside their devoted base. Is liberalism in America going away forever? No, but the brand we have had to suffer is going to need to change drastically before they are a serious threat again, at least at the ballot box.",

Not much has really changed. They still spread their propaganda and put a spin on everything possible. Another problem are these so called fact check sites that aren't doing the Republicans any favors and we need to find a way to counter that or I'm afraid we're going to lose after Trump is gone. Btw, if you talk to democrats on reddit, it doesn't seem like to me that they're waking up at all. To the contrary actually. Take a look at r/democrats at the post and the comments. \n\nTrump may have earned a 76% approval rating from viewers but you have to keep in mind that most of the viewers were Republicans.  \n\nI also believe there's still cheating going on in the elections. Trump won fast enough that they didn't have time to cheat by adding mail in ballots everywhere they needed them.  I'd bet my last dollar that even though they mayor of Chicago has like a 6.5% approval rating, they'll still get another democrat mayor after he's gone. Same with these other major cities like LA and St. Louis just to name a couple.  It doesn't make sense. No matter how bad these cities get, or how far left the politicians go,  they keep putting the same people in office. I have a hard time believing that.",

Friends on other social media platforms are suddenly reposting tons of misinformation and flat out lies that prey on their previously passive confirmation bias. They really have everyone whipped up into a frenzy, I don't have high hopes for the state of our society over the next 4 years and the media is largely to blame. They're ruining lives.",

It's to the point where they lost the ability to be subtle with their messaging, similar to how cable news ripped off the mask and went full psycho. \n\nFor example, the late issue of the Ultimates (alternate universe Avengers) introduces a fascist group using the punishers logo, but painted red for the Red Skull. See, the Red Skull is a Nazi, and in real life they hate that \"right-wingers\" have used the punisher logo. So this is their way of taking it back, or trying to tie the real life people wearing a punisher logo with Nazis.",

They all seem to be liberal, of course, so I made a remark about being on the losing side and then they banned me. I didn\u2019t really care about the sub at all, but I asked the moderator to explain why my content warranted a permanent ban.  He or she provided a response that didn\u2019t make much sense to me, so I asked for clarification, and they said that if I kept messaging them, they would report me to Reddit for harassment. I think I messaged them twice and I was nothing but polite. Again, it wasn\u2019t a sub that I cared about, but I just thought it was kind of odd that they would be so quick on the trigger to issue permanent bans.",

They are essentially the \"New Era\" democrats, but ironically, they call folks like us fascists, which is quite far from the truth.\n\nI can get along with, and in some cases, even respect, some of the views of a traditional \"Old School\" liberal, but that's not at all what these folks are.\n\nA traditional liberal would cringe at the idea of law fare, where we use the legal system as a tool to take out our political enemies.  They'd also cringe at the kind of censorship we've seen, and likewise, forced government mandates of drugs/vaccinations and such.  And the suppression of opposing views in the name of \"science\" or \"fact checking\", are largely areas that would disturb a true liberal.  If we all accepted science as one never-changing, unchallengeable universal truth, we'd still be burning witches at the stake and trying not to sail off the edge of the earth!",

There is a narrative on this site you must follow, and if you don\u2019t, you will be buried. \n\nI argued with someone about that in the weekly /r/conservative discussion thread. They said how can you be proponents of free speech and then lock most posts for flaired users only? I said it\u2019s quite easy. You all brigade the sub with downvotes already, can you imagine if you all you spam the comments and upvote each other? It\u2019s not a matter of free speech, it\u2019s simply not letting the sub\u2019s post get overrun with bad faith brigaders who just want to instigate and derail the post. \n\nOf course they didn\u2019t agree and thought everyone should \u201cface the consequences of what they say\u201d. \n\nWhat the actual fuck does that mean? These people are lunatic thought police. I should be punished because I think differently than you and your Reddit hive mind?\n\nI don\u2019t trust these people. Subs like /r/byebyejob. These people want to Ruin. Your. Life. If you disagree with them. I\u2019ve already had some of these losers crawl my profile and make threats to me since I had a previous residence in a post (it was in the background with no address present). \n\nBe careful.

Most of us were not fans of Biden/Harris or the dems, but we don't want anyone to die. We just wanted to beat them at the polls.*\n\nThat's the essential difference between us and them. We want to win the battle in the marketplace of ideas. They want their opponents dead.",

Compared to spray painting a swastika and breaking windows and burning cars to the ground\n\nLike that's not even in the same league as a sticker on a gas pump. Yet they defend it. Sick",

It's just a small minority of crazies that tried to take away all of our rights.\n\nIt's mind blowing tbh that these people can't see reality as a whole.\n\nMy fav is the Ukraine protest organizers who when you post the link to volunteer for the foreign legion they all down vote. \n\nThey just wanna virtue signal and as soon as you give them a means to really do something they scatter like roaches.",

They spray painted all over the place, put phrases like \u201cTrump is a c*nt\u201d and painted \u201cGaza is not for sale\u201d on a green. They also dug holes all over the place. The pictures were posted in r/pics, which of course has turned into just another far left American bash Trump and company sub. Pretty funny that a sub that was just supposed to be a place to post cool pictures turned into one of the most political and far left leaning on all of Reddit since 2016. They also instaban anyone who has posted in any remotely right leaning sub as soon as you make one post there.\n\nThe thread with the golf course pictures is filled with people approving of the vandalism, asking why more wasn\u2019t done, why things like that aren\u2019t being done to his properties here, etc. The sad part is all the vandalism did was make a mess for some poor workers to clean up that have nothing to do with Trump of even the US.\n\nEven sadder is that course is considered one of the first places of golf in Scotland. It was falling into disrepair until Trump bought it and put a ton of money into it to restore it for the community there. It\u2019s not even a big money maker for him, he did it because he loves the game and because of the historical significance of the course.\n\nThese same people cheer on any random vandalism of Teslas or Tesla dealerships, charging stations, etc. \n\nPeople are just broken, Trump literally broke their brains. Many Democrats, far leftists, etc have all had their brains completely scrambled due to their unhinged hatred of one man because the device in their hands told them the orange man is bad and a fascist nazi authoritarian dictator bad man.",

They hear about some protest rally happening near them, and they go to find a few dozen people being largely ignored by passersby. They hear two people talking in public and are bewildered that they seem to approve of Trump's actions. (And worse, those two people don't look like white nationalists!) They wonder how the world could have changed so much in less than a year. And they know that this past six weeks is just the tip of the iceberg.",

It was great when I was a lib, I had tons of friends and a nice little echo chamber, but after I switched, I lost like 98% of my friends and they\u2019re all on like Facebook posting obsessively about Trump and MAGA and whatever else. Some will unfriend / block you for being conservative, but others will leave you on their list so you can see their shit but will freeze you out socially. Whatever. \n\nSome of them are fed workers (or were, as the case may be) and I honestly am totally fine with them not working in government anymore. \n\nI ended up moving out to frederick county in VA \u2026 it was close enough that my husband could still get to Tyson\u2019s for work 3 days a week although it was hell of a trip \u2026 but it\u2019s way more red here and honestly pretty peaceful. \n\nOf course it\u2019s also the last place that\u2019s still kind of affordable to live and still commute to the DMV so some of the feds with hybrid or remote schedules started moving here, but with the feds getting fired that seems to have slowed down a bit thankfully",

Muscle loss + bone loss are significant \n\n&gt;Without the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.",

The sooner we are completely open and honest about our beliefs the sooner it can be addressed.  The truth is that significant portions of the population have been radicalized for decades now.  It can only be a good thing that all is revealed.\n\nMost that identify as centrist are feckless and never pay much attention.  The crazier things get the harder it is to ignore and the bigger the bullseye.  Bring it on.\n\nIt is the conservative's responsibility to make it a point to always remind the center that the craziness is just the surface and there is a political dogma below it that inspires these people.  The crazies aren't nuts -- they are utterly ideologically captured.  That they have no shame and, therefore, are fantastically dangerous.",

If you're going to be pedantic, at least be correct...\n\n&gt;Many citizens today do not realize that the U.S. government offered the families of American war dead burial options following the war. Like World \r\nWar I, families of those killed abroad could choose burial in an overseas military cemetery or choose to repatriate the remains of a loved one to U.S. soil.  **More than 60 percent of WWII families chose to have the remains returned to the United States for interment.** The repatriation program operated at a scale unprecedented in history. Service members representing every military branch and all segments of U.S. society were repatriated, many for burial in America\u2019s national cemeteries, then managed by the Army. In 1973, many of \r\nthese cemeteries transferred to the VA with the establishment of the National Cemetery System. That system became the NCA in 1998. As of June 2020, there are 158 national cemeteries in all. NCA administers 143 of them. Two \u2013 Arlington and the U.S. Soldiers\u2019 and Airmen\u2019s Home nationalcemeteries \u2013 are still administered by the Army. Fourteen national cemeteries are maintained by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service. \n\nhttps://www.cem.va.gov/docs/wcag/history/WWII-Burial-Program-America.pdf",

It's supposed to symbolize hope and liberty for immigrants arriving in America. \n\nBut just like everything else, the Democrats have keenly found a way to ruin that in an attempt to keep themselves in power. And now we see that the French don't want us to Make America Great Again....\n\nIf it were up to me, tell France if they want our Statue of Liberty back, come on and see if you can take it!  But be warned, try to take our Statue of Liberty, we will pull out of NATO, boot the UN out of our country, stop sending aid and providing security to every country on the planet, and from that moment forward, Europe and the French can pay for their defense, and fight their own battles!\n\nNah, that's a bit harsh... Here's an idea, let's set up a GoFundMe to build them a huge statue of a Frenchman doing their famous \"pre-combat capitulation ritual\"...",
