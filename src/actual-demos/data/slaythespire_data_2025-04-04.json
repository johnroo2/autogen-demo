No relics with combat effects and low health seal the deal. The usual strat for this fight is to kill Bear first and if you cant do that turn one it gets way harder. I think one of the reasons its so fucking funny is because of how believable the card choices are hahaha, pretty sure ive died with this exact decklist like 10 times lmao",

One of them only works if you have no other block though. One of them makes frost orb, but they have no way to get focus yet so that's just pretty decent. One that gives you +1 energy the following turn.\n\nA pretty decent attack card that attacks twice for 1 energy\n\n2 attack cards that cost 0 and do very little damage. One of them scales in damage but very slowly unless you have multiple copies or really good deck manipulation (they don't have either)\n\nA card that is amazing if you can play it, but costs 5 energy. The only way this deck can do that is if they play their +1 energy defend card the turn before, but again, they don't have deck manipulation so it has to be pure luck. They're probably hoping for more energy cards in the future\n\nA mediocre attack card whose real benefit is that it will allow you to play one of defect's most powerful cards (+4/5 focus) without it's significant downside (-1 focus per turn), but they don't have the super good card to pair it with\n\nIt's a deck that is looking for some specific cards for powerful synergy, but doesn't have any of them yet. What makes it funny is that most of us have fished for a number of these card combos in the past, so it's relatable, but it's funny to see so many in one deck.",

I have already put \"too much\" time into playing this game, into learning this game, etc, and I still don't know everything. I don't play optimally. I now play this pretty brainy puzzly lucky game at regular difficulty, savescum when I want, and don't give it a second thought. I bought the game, and I'm playing it how I want to. I love that I can play it my way, and you folks who are better, smarter, and probably better hung than me too can get as deep as you like into solving the game.

So the events where you do the card matching and the \"Find Loot\" if you get a curse or the monster appears, you can save and quit and continue to do it again. It doesn't change the card order on the card matching either so you can figure out where all of the cards you want are, and the number of times you can find loot before the monster appears doesn't change either. \n\nThere's other things you can do too, but those are two examples.",

It\u2019s generally agreed upon that donu deca are easier than the other 2 because the only challenge they present is killing fast and/or blocking a lot, which any good deck wants to do. \n\nPeople tend to notice way more when they get unlucky vs lucky. Take note of all the times you\u2019re running a shiv deck or a power deck and don\u2019t see the boss you fear. It\u2019s probably the majority of the time below ascension 20 (your expected value is seeing the one you\u2019re afraid of 1/3 of the time). In general though, think about those bosses if you have a deck like that and see if you can add an alternate win con to your deck. I\u2019ve had several runs with creative ai as my main source of scaling, for example, and I pick up a recycle to go infinite against awakened one. It\u2019s a slow setup and not super viable, but it lets me get by the one fight",

Conversely, if you clear all of the elites just fine, your deck can already pretty much handle Donu &amp; Deca.\n\n\nSo ultimately it's just an example of survivorship bias.",

Then its strength gain is obviously useless.\n\n\nSo far, it has worked every time I've made it to Awakened One as Defect (up to A15 so far), but I die quite a lot before then so idk if this strategy can be called \"optimal\" for the entire run :p",

You don't need 20 cards that are only good for dominating hallways. But also this is what draw is for, to sift through your deck for the cards you need.\n\n\nLearn how to avoid overcommitting/overspecializing. i.e. If your deck has 3 blade dances and a terror and shuriken and 2 accuracies, you already have enough damage scaling. That means recognizing malaise is probably a better addition than phantasmal killer because it shores up an area currently your deck has no answer to.\n\n\nIt also means you probably shouldn't be drafting even more blade dances no matter how tempting or synergistic it seems because they don't aid your worst matchups.\n\nAs for catalyst, it isn't any harder to pick up than any other card. Obviously you can't do it every time but it's something you can actually pivot to just by adding 2-4 cards if the opportunity presents itself. That's very possible to do inside a single act.",

Unless you can make shivs do 120 damage like someone else said. The heart kills me so much faster than I deal damage. I need roughly a 20 per card ratio to win if I remember right. That's not even counting the attacks. Still have no idea how to get my normal damage output high enough tbh. \n\nThe cards weren't dead weight until I literally couldn't play them due to time eater. Playing time eater is like playing champion with a poison build. Actively doing now and will 100% get stomped because I don't have enough ways to deal with it once he cures his poison.",

So\u00a0draft more tools for the boss, and stop drafting for hallways once you can deal with those adequately.\n\n\nObviously this is a bit reductive and a lot of it comes down to \"get more experience with the game\", but you need to at least understand the philosophy.

Arguably Game of Thrones also, though there are even fewer spellcasters and people with magical abilities eg the Faceless Men.)\n\nIf you built Silent in such a system, she's a rogue/assassin/alchemist type of character, very agile, sneaky, hides in the darkness, throws shivs of which she seems to have an unlimited supply, and uses martial arts techniques (though a different school to the Watcher).\n\nIf you wanted to build her or any of them in a D&amp;D-ish class-and-level game this would be very difficult, they really need to be around 6th to 10th level to have enough abilities to do the things they do and their multiclass burden would be ridiculous. In a Forged in the Dark or Powered by the Apocalypse type narrative game though, it's much less of an issue: characters can basically \"do what they're meant to do\", as long as it makes narrative sense.",

Also half the deck being upgrade might be too low. How often does that ever happen? (Genuinely not sure).\n\nI still feel like event relic would be great, no changes needed in the wording.\n\nOther than Mind Bloom like I already mentioned, I could see something like Red Mask relic (shrine?) being similar. Great relic, the trade if makes sense sometimes, but other time it asks you to remove more than a relic\u2019s worth of gold.\n\nI think the trade off would need to be large, but skippable.",

Vanilla is a snoozefest I need a couple hundred modded relics, packmaster, potion packs, extra event options, etc. This would fit in perfectly with a variety of other modded content, which I think is the best way to look at stuff like this. Everyone is comparing it to base game but no-one would add singular relics or cards at a time, making the comparison moot.",

As I think about this more, I think my reasoning is purely based on \u201cthis doesn\u2019t feel like a boss relic.\u201d\n\nSomething like busted crown or curse key have clear downsides and also clear pick scenarios. But on any given run, this relic could presumably give you +/- any number of energy.\n\nWhile it could be an equal trade off. Still feels too volatile for me as a boss relic. Nonetheless would be very interesting to encounter.",

Later on you would probably already have your better cards upgraded, so you'd be weighing whether it makes sense to upgrade your worse cards at the cost of downgrading your best cards. If you somehow managed to get far without upgrading many cards then it could become a win-more relic. But even then, it would just be worse than an Apothecary if you drew it early since it could have been another boss relic instead.",

I noticed the 4th character they showed almost looks like an evolved version of the defect, so maybe the story will be about the other 3 trying to locate different pieces of the defect so they can transfer his programming to the new body. One will find a better core, the next will find the old body to grab the memory flies, and the third will find the new body. It's nice to dream I guess.",

I was barely slogging through the run, relying on a ton of block and frost to keep alive while I did pitiful damage in every combat.  I had to waste every rest site healing just to hang on by a thread.\n\n But then, in the last few events before the boss (where I was sure to lose with a whimper), I was able to pull a consume and blizzard. Then the last question mark was the event that allows you to upgrade all your cards at the cost of healing, and with 65/74 hp, I took that bet and smashed the doughnut and cube guy at the top! \n\nI've had half a dozen other runs that felt so much more promising, only to die at the boss, I couldn't believe that the stars aligned just right at the very end to carry me through! \n\nSorry for the random tangent, I was just super pumped how everything worked out and I don't know anyone else that plays lol. This game is so sick",

Probably apoth, especially since ironclad already has plenty of 2-3 cost attack cards\n\nSilent: apoth is very useful for her starter deck, adds consistency to her annoying additional strike and defend, but silents options for single high damage cards is rather lacking. Cards of hers that love upgrades are quite a few, wrath form, foot work, and a few others; but i think HoG could still be worth it on her. My opinion is kind of split here\n\nDefect: apotheosis is it; and defect being upgrade starved is a well discussed thing lol\n\nWatcher: eruption -&gt; miracle -&gt; hand of greed destroys most hallway fights and does a chunk against elites. Obviously not ideal if they're gonna survive it and you cant quickly enter calm yet, or poor draw order screws you as can oft happens early game, but it can be potent when it lines up. Watcher does have a few key upgrades (eruption and rushdown come to mind) and her starting miracle gets buffed if apoth is played first, but im greatly leaning towards HoG for her.",

They only need 1 card it\u2019s good on, not a whole deck.\n\nSecondly they rarely have costs, junk exists but that\u2019s it. So unless your card has a drawback on it, such as spawn with 1 snow or deal 1 damage to itself on attack, it will be purely positive. \n\nBut mostly, Wildfrost\u2019s numbers are WAY lower than STS\u2019s. The damage numbers are between 2 and 6 normally, and the effects are commonly just 1 applied at once. +1 in that is impactful, but +1 in here doesn\u2019t do much most of the time. Your defends do 6 block, useless, where Wildfrost\u2019s basic snow attack does double damage and 50% more cc.\n\nI think this could be cool but it\u2019s very niche, much more than Wildfrost, to find a cool synergy.",

Automaton also gets two specific cards that let them buff up these merged cards: One skill that ups all numbers by 1 while you're merging them, and another power that bumps all numbers on a merged card by one every time you DRAW it.\n\n\nWhat makes this crazy is that Automaton starts with a single \"Draw 1\" card and a there's a common card that says \"Gain 1 energy, put a (not 1, A) dazed in your deck\". And since these are mergeable, you can get a \"Draw 3, Gain 2 energy, Do something else at +1\" card for 1 energy after drawing it once.\n\n\n(Crazy enough, I'm not even sure if Automaton is the most broken character of the mod- the set-up DOES mean you need one full deck rotation before you start seeing your crazy fused cards.)",

Defect with reinforced body would help with some cheap block. Watcher using Collect can have a lot of energy on demand.\n\nDefect just channelling a lot of orbs is pretty cool. Necronomicon gets real funky. Berserk+ for Ironclad could be neat. Ice cream makes this a lot easier.\n\nOverall though it's only a card you can take if you already have a deck it works with, which is fine, but the lack of up-front value makes life difficult",

This should probably draw 2 cards instead, it would be more fitting since, you know, pot of greed draw 2 cards.\n\nEDIT: I just realized it's 'whenever you draw any (amount of) cards', not 'whenever you draw a card'.

It's pretty solid if your deck lacks draw, actually.\n\nIt gives you 1 copy of the \"Pot of Greed\" for every 12 cards added to your deck (plus your deck size when you pick it up). The Pot of Greed card lets you draw 2 cards, but you can't play anymore Pot of Greed's that turn afterward. \n\nUpgrading the cards themselves makes it so you can play another Pot of Greed afterward. It's actually a genuinely fantastically designed relic.",

It\u2019s problematic because it can whiff and there\u2019s limited time and you can bottom deck it, but Donu Deca is a pretty easy fight so it\u2019s more an issue of how much chip you take from them rather than whether you win or not, imo.",

You end up needing to find specific solutions to the Time Eater fight way more often. I guess you could end up with a Defect orb build that makes Time Eater the easiest fight. You could even end up in this position with Watcher. However, the vast majority of the times I have a good block plan, I also have a good enough deck to beat Donu/Deca when I get there.",

No artifact to stop weaken, two turns of not being attacked at all, strength down is super effective, only one attack on the big hit so you can get through it with buffer (or a fairy/liz tail). The vulnerable sucks, but if you've got a way to prevent that and can inflict weaken, you're only looking at 60ish total damage damage compared to a far harder to counter 120ish across the first four turns in donu deca.\n\nHeart honestly lets you go pretty slow, turn 2&amp;3 are nasty but if you've got an answer to those, it's usually not until turn 8/9 that you're in real trouble. 11/12 or 14/15 are the deadline for most decks. Even that far into the fight if you've got something like ice cream malaise or upgraded dark shackles it's possible to survive the 20x15. As long as you're inflicting weak and have a way to deal with the multi attacks, it's just 40ish damage once every 4 turns.\n\nThere's definitely a world where a barricade + entrench deck doesn't get set up fast enough to block turn 1-4 of donu deca, and runs out of block before being able to start scaling it with entrench. But for heart? Drink an artifact potion, tanks through turns 2&amp;3, lines up a nice entrench -&gt; headbutt -&gt; entrench on turn4, and now can scale fast enough that it could even survive turn 17/18's 72x15 with the help of a clothesline (54x15). Turn 20/21 is where you're truly dead without intangible, enormous quantities of strength down, or paper krane.\n\nHeart is a tough fight, but it's also a very unique one, and there are a lot of ways to solve the heart that simply won't work elsewhere.\n\nS&amp;S is a lot more similar to the donu deca fight, but that also means that if my deck is bad vs donu deca i might need to save my potions for S&amp;S instead of using them to beat donu deca.",

People like feeling so powerful that they don't have to think about playing their cards. Stuff like starting the turn with a 0 cost infernal blade, for example, is a heuristic that's satisfying to play.\n\nTime eater punishes decks that otherwise would be in this sweet spot specifically FOR being in the sweet spot. The other bosses can punish these decks as well but its more nuanced. Time eater, in my opinion, punishes *people* more than decks because you might respect her mechanic either too much or not enough and both are really bad.\n\nIn more nuanced threads, there are plenty of people who treat the 3 more reasonably. That said, its worth pointing out that donu &amp; deca are solved in a similar way to the elite in act 4, so players who do heart runs probably prefer to face them.",

Usually stall deck lacks the means to play a specific amount of cards reliably and thus falls terribly behind and got fucked over by Time eater. Spam deck got better at this but the defense can be a little suspect.",

It's also a pretty broad type of punishment that doesn't feel super unique to time eater.\n\nThe problem is that you have to make it consistent. If you play a 4 card turn, and then a 5 card turn, your last turn is gonna be a 3 card turn. If you play 4/3/3 cards then your last turn is gonna be a 2 card turn. Similarly, if you have a big 9-10 cards turn then your last turn is gonna be a 2-3 cards turn.\n\nSimply put, Time eater punishes deck that doesn't have consistent output parity and relying on playing 1-2 big turns to blow up the boss while stalling for those big turns. Most act 3 decks tend to fall into this type of category, thus Time eater punish most act 3 decks.\n\nSo if the deck has consistent output parity, then Timmy is much less of a problem. But most act 3 deck aren't like that, so Timmy becomes a big problem.",

But I dont feel it the other way around.\n\n\nYeah they scale fast and they hit hard every turn, but so does other act3 monsters and elites. If you manage to get there confortably you usually beat them.\n\n\nIn the other hand, Awakening one and Time Eater may punish you even if you blaze through act3.",

Sure, having your first attack be this and getting 11-12 free damage to every remaining enemy is great... but you skip your next turn. I can think of a few ways to mitigate the downside (build up lots of Frost orbs first, incense burner and calipers, to name a few), but those all require setup where you can't play attacks until you get in position, then you need to have the beam in hand and the energy to play it. Plus, I'd imagine a deck built for this would still struggle against most act 3 bosses and the heart.\n\nThat being said, if this card existed, I'd try to make it work every time.",

This also lets the card be affected by strength only in the current combat. \nAlso I would make it deal at least 8 damage in combat, I think 3(4) is very fair outside of combat, it might be broken against reptomancer though depending if it reduced her spawned daggers health.",

Like not only does the character start with the highest amount of defends, her other basic starting card is slightly better defend and the other card is another defensive tool in giving target weak tokens. \n\nAnd all this start on an act where fast damage is more important than ever. 2/3 of the elites come with fairly quickly ramping clock to end the fight (Gremlin vs Silent is not a fun encounter). One end boss has serious clock to burst it down quickly (Slime), Hexagon falls to similar field to a smaller extent and even if Guardian is the most marathony, you need to be able to have high enough offensive spikes to trigger the defense mode and her base tools offer nothing to deal with those checks.",

Her card pool has the best options for scaling those defends as the run progresses. In my experience it's better to focus on just drafting quality offensive tools, and treating removal as a luxury until your deck has the answers it needs.\n \nHaving one or two fewer defends just isn't going to move the needle that much in terms of offensive output early on--silent with 5 strikes and no defends still dies to nob--and given that removals are a finite resource I think removing strike is correct in the majority of cases. It's Slay the Spire though so there are always exceptions.",

You've gotta kill the first jaw worm, kill repto daggers, prevent a darkling from attacking, beat on transient, etc, and efficient damage cards do that. The main difference is that 10 damage is usually a lot less valuable than 9 health as enemy health pools scale up.",

The one benefit that Strikes have over Defect\u2019s damage orbs is that strikes can target specific enemies.   I\u2019ve found on my recent runs that the threshold for redundancy is lower for defends cause you only need a couple cards to be set with frost orbs but it can take a while to fully scale up your lighting orbs.  (Caveat that while I have beaten A20 on defect right now I am having to go through it again on my laptop and am only around A10 rn and haven\u2019t played A20 Defect in a while)",

But bursting down enemies in one turn only works if you have a high enough density of attacks, pure block card s can really mess you over and often force you to not play your powerful enter wrath cards.\n\nThat and 12 damage for 1 mana is not embarrasing frontload, talk to the hand also raises the value of strikes a bit more.",

Corruption exists, letter opener exists, flechettes exist, etc. Strikes have strike dummy which makes them marginally less useless and I guess perfected strike which I  strongly dislike. Carrying enough feeble attacks to make patrike scale all the way to mediocre is just asking to brick your draw and I want no part of it.",

Dead enemies are a block card. If you're in wrath then strikes hit for 12 and defends still only block for five, they're not very useful. Also when you hit that wrath button then it's really important that everything dies before it has a chance to hit you back, so consistently drawing attacks is a good thing. Obviously you will need some sort of block at some point, but defends are never going to cut it.",

If the strike gets upgraded for some reason, like at the blinding light event or off a relic, it deals 18 in wrath and 27 with wrath and vuln. So strikes have real potential to do actual damage even later in the run.\n\nDefends are kinda the opposite, if you are unfortunate enough to end your turn in wrath, 5 block isn't going to help much against double damage.\n\nI usually make relatively thin decks so I can manage stances better and get infinites easier. You usually block damage as watcher by killing your opponent before they get too many turns.",

You're not picking for difficult to hit late game synergies.  You're picking to beat the potential damage race boss, and to survive until synergies become viable.  Any synergy choices you make need to already be on your deck or need to be good enough as a stand alone.

That makes strike remove attractive early on in a lot of cases. That\u2019s probably the biggest reason after thinking about it more.\n\nI also think ironclad has kinda crap defensive commons outside of shrug, so I find myself relying on defends, max hp and burning blood more so than I would rely on the starting defends on other classes.\n\nIf I get offered zero decent damage in act 1 to the point where I think I need strikes to win, then I will obviously remove a defend (or probably not remove at all), but I just find that a very uncommon experience on ironclad. \n\nI do think defends having synergy with ironclads best defensive plan (exhaust) while strikes having little synergy with any good late game plan is a relevant factor.",

There are 2 common and 3 uncommon poison cards.  All of which are incredible Act 1, and after Act 1, strikes are effectively unplayable whereas defends are at least situationally useful.  Silent also has dexterity as an effect which lets you go longer in fights safely, and a decent mix of other offensive cards.\n\nI might be misjudging what I do with the defect.  He has frost cards that can almost single handedly cover your defense so I can sometimes all-on on killing defensive cards, but I do feel like aside from that, I'm getting rid of strikes as his orbs are just much too efficient offensively to want to play strikes.",

And usually with Silent I remove a defend, maybe two in the right conditions, and then the rest of my removes will be Strikes. I'm probably going to be removing at least one of each anyway, and since there's a good chance I'll encounter Nob and/or Chosen, getting rid of some of Silent's weaker skills early on is crucial when she wants to play so many already.",

It also allows more freedom to take block cards in Act 1. I've also been getting Strike Dummy or Perfected Strike lately. I also keep getting offered bites in Act 2, so see removing Strikes as a \"waste\". In Act 2, defends are also super bad. You get frailed quite a lot and then they only block for 3 so they're basically just curses. I do think in any case, Defend removes are underrated.",

That being said, there is some bias depending on the character:\n\nSilent and Defect tend to remove Strikes because they can deal damage in ways that don\u2019t scale with attacks (poison, orbs). Even Shivs technically count as attacks, but if you're running a Shiv deck, your damage isn't coming from Strength\u2014it's coming from scaling that doesn\u2019t affect most other attacks (increased Shiv damage &amp; 0-cost card damage).\n\nWatcher is the exact opposite, as it tends to remove Defends. Watcher has an easy way to scale generic attacks with Wrath and generally wants to dominate fights with lots of damage, finishing them quickly. Calm doesn\u2019t have the same synergy with defensive cards\u2014in fact, quite the opposite. Most of the time, Calm is just setup for Wrath.\n\nIronclad fully depends on whether you go for a Strength-scaling route or a Barricade route, but these decks usually only take shape in the later stages of the game. In general, Ironclad really wants to keep a balance between offense and defense.",

Luck does not play a factor in not getting an impossible seed, you're more likely to win the lottery than you are to ever see one.\n\nAlso, are you actually trying to tell us that the players putting up 80%+ win rates on A20 are just lucky?",

It's not incorrect either, it's about a certain mindset of players. When I climbed the ascensions, I was pretty focused on the strategy/skill based parts of the game. Once I reached ascension 20, instead of winstreaking and playing optimally, I was more interested in trying funny combos and willing to roll the dice on the luck based aspects of the game. The meme works for me and honestly, there is no way to quantify if this is a majority opinion among players or not.",

Perhaps in terms of \"just getting through Gold Stake/A20\" you can just keep going til you hit a high roll with Balatro whereas that won't work in STS, but for consistency in gold stake/A20 I wouldn't say the difference is that huge.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure how useful it really is to compare the two games. Despite the aesthetics balatro is really more of an auto-battler than a deckbuilding roguelike IMO. The core design is very, very different. Balatro has minimal resource management and builds don't have to care about flexibility or dealing with specific threats, just about being able to scale hard enough.",

Perhaps it's unfair to call it \"minimal\" but it's definitely much much simpler. And, unlike STS, there are many cards/jokers that produce money. Rather than a resource to be carefully managed money in Balatro is more of a resource you need to ensure your build produces enough of.\n\nTarots also exist, but they're relatively minor compared to potions and the game heavily incentivizes you to use them quickly (as holding a Death means you can't find another Death, and you want to use as many Deaths as possible).\n\nAnd yes, bosses are a threat. But only a small subset occurs in any given run, and most won't affect any given deck. They're really not as consequential as the enemies in STS which deeply affect the things you think about when building your deck the entire run. I think this is kind of proven by the fact that Violet Vessel is broadly considered the most difficult final boss blind, and it's simply asking you to scale very hard.",

Seems more like the very good players lose when they are unlucky rather than win when they are lucky. The fact that you can't acheive 100% winrate seems more to do with unlucky or potentially unwinnable maps rather than luck every time they win.\n\nLuck alone is pretty much never going to make you get a 52 streak of anything. For example, flipping a coin heads 52 times in a row is a 1 in 2.2\\*10^(16) .For a 20 streak of coin-flipping, it's a 1 in 1 000 000. I would definitely say that it's not a 50/50 luck, and if you have enough luck to win significantly more often than 50% of the time, I wouldn't really say you need all that much luck.\n\nThe best players seems to be going on win-streaks more often than not\n\nIt's very easy to fall into the trap mindset that because you died in an elite combat where you drew poorly was because you didn't have luck, which can obviously happen. But it's very hard to factor in every part of the deck building, if you pathed too agressively to survive a below-average draw based on your pots/deck, if you pathed too passively and didn't get enough relics in act 1/2, bought the wrong items in the shop etc...\n\nI also used Lifecoach as an example because he's been an exceptional poker player, one of the best Hearthstone players when he was active and also an amazing StS player. It's not luck that made him get the best streak with the most OP charachter, it's down to him being a world-class card game player across multiple card games.",

Sure, gambling chip helps. Bag of prep helps. Good snecko costs help, potions can be huge. Say you rocked in there with none of the relics that give you more draw or intangible and you've kept an ancient potion to block vulnerable and a fairy, because those were your best options. You have four starter cards left in your deck. You draw them all plus bane on turn one, then all five statuses on turn two. You're now two turns behind the damage curve and probably losing the fairy on turn three.  Now let's put three of your best cards on the bottom of the deck so you still haven't seen them. Worst case scenario? Maybe. But whether or not it happens is down to the RNG.",

Of course having bad luck can brick you and you die. Doesnt have to be at the heart, can happen much earlier.

I\u2019m sure you know people in all three camps (or really, this is probably a spectrum). \n\nOn r/mathmemes, it happens pretty often that the top comment is someone correcting part of the meme. Mathematics as a discipline is very precise and detail oriented, so you get a higher density of people in the middle/on the end of the spectrum I defined. I think it is just naturally the case that some people can see someone be wrong and feel ok about it, and some people see someone be wrong and want to do something about it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about how serious slay the spire is, I think it\u2019s about how seriously you take other people being wrong about things you know.",

At A10 you can see how someone could have 100% winrate if they're skilled enough. At A20, you know that some runs are objectively unwinnable, and since you can't see the future you have to prepare for the most likely scenarios and hope that an unlikely scenario doesn't come up.",

The key to killing time eater if you're relying on shivs is more about how you plan your turns. If you can play 12 cards a turn, the fight is a complete pushover. You'll kill him long before his strength scales enough. One or two piercing wails in your deck, a malaise, some dex, all go a long way. If you can't play 12 cards, maybe you shouldn't play that blade dance, so you still have cards to block next turn, for example",

But I think there is more to it to be discussed.\n\nThere is an idea that in tests of skill if there is a luck element the luckier player(s) will win more often because the skill element is maxed out.\n\nA couple examples staying in the video game world:\n\n1.) speedruns of games. Speedrunners are generally HIGHLY skilled at the game of choice but there are still luck elements that determine outcomes in many of them. Attacks can miss/crit in pokemon games. Fighters in mike tyson punchout can do their long animations/bad patterns. Glitches can be inconsistent. Ect ect.\n\n2.) challenege runs. Things like doing a no hit run of eldenring (or all the souls games back to back) takes a huge amount of skill. But it also takes luck (or at the very least inhuman skill).\n\nI think A20H of STS also fits in here. Players like life coach, xecnar, baalor, jorbs, ect are all incredibly skilled at the game but none of them will ever have a 100% win rate because there are too many elements of the game that are luck based.\u00a0\n\nLike xecnar recently went on 2 huge winstreaks of cyxling though the characters seperated by a single loss. If you gave that single loss seed to 10 spire pros do you think all 10 of them would win it? If not you kind of have to admit the outcome was luck based.",

When those kinds of records exist, it's very egotistical of me to say \"that one was impossible\", when the far simpler answer is most often \"I could have played that better\".",

Calling the game a \"dice roll\" on high asc is weird, since beatable seeds are absolutely like 90%+.\n\nIf I went to a football subreddit and told them how penalties are all RNG and it's a dice roll to hit the goal, people would say \"hey maybe practice more and penalties aren't that much of a dice roll\". Not incredibly toxic of a comment.\n\nLuck and skill are both parts, sure. Skill is 90%+ to converting a run and therefore blaming luck for taking months and hundreds of runs to beat a20 means that you probably don't understand how much is skill.",
