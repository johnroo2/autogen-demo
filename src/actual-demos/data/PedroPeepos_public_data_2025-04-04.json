We will be reaching out to the mods of LR's opponents during each scrims block and we will be sharing lists of chatters who decide to go there and spread negativity, hate or any toxicity. Doing so will lead to **instant and permanent bans** in Caedrel's chat and the chats of the other LR boys as well. \n\nThe majority of our community has been nothing but supportive and appreciation posts about not just LR but even enemy teams have been popping up on the subreddit and we are very grateful for that. Sadly, with a community this large (and growing every day), there will be toxic and annoying rats who think that somehow putting down the opposition makes LR look better - in fact, it does the exact opposite.\n\nWe want to help build a community that spreads positivity and we will do our best to do so. If any of you spot a chatter that you suspect from drama baiting or spreading toxicity and negativity, please feel free to reach out to our mods on Twitch and let them know.\n\nThanks for being awesome rats and see you around, xddkiss.",

When baus was asked what he wants to play, and said it is kayn angle or renekton but he rather plays kayn. Teammates were not that supportative, but Rekky knows he has authority, and just says, \"dont listen to anyone else, i have the mouse, ill pick you kayn\" then baus is like \"what do you guys think\", everyone saying renekton then rekky locks kayn, absolute cinema, and he eats the gwen when it matters. \n\nedit: and it happened already as well.",

I get that he has adhd zoomer brain but he needs to lockin and focus for the team. If he didn't play subway surfers maybe he could have drafted better against KCB, a silver 3 draft instead of bronze 3",
