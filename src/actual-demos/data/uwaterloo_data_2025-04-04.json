Today I got complaint from the university that my artwork violates their rights got my money removed from my account and banned from positing on redbubble. \u201cIt is important that users of the Redbubble marketplace only upload their own original artwork.\u201d\n\nI know I made like 10 cents a sticker but still wtf\ud83d\ude2d they\u2019re that stingy ?? I made the font , the art , the stupid lil illustrations. If you go on redbubble so much uw merch is on there. Don\u2019t innovate at the most innovative university I guess lmao.",

You're using faculty icons, faculty names, and faculty colours.\u00a0 You really are just selling stuff associated with the university and it's brand. Go ahead and remind me what a goose wearing a pink tie with the words Waterloo math means again?\n\n\nYes it's a stupid little thing, but large entities will just routinely will go through and put a chilling effect on anyone trampling in their brand.\u00a0\n\n\nYou might argue you're just a little guy not really selling anything, but arguing that you aren't squarely and deliberately trading on the university's brand is disingenuous.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd if you argue that you're not.making money then why do you care.\n\n\nBasically you just got some education on how stuff works from uw.....for free!",

All in all my life is good. \n\nWaterloo wasn\u2019t always the best environment for a social life to thrive. People were competitive, some in a super dickhead kind of way, and everyone was always studying. I hope the campus now is more social and inviting than when I was a student. \n\nBut man, I just miss when my biggest stress was passing an exam. I miss hanging out with my friends all night and just laughing. I miss going out multiple nights a week. I miss seeing my friends EVERYDAY. I know a lot of people in this group worry about co-ops, and their grades and all that stuff which is important. But these are gonna be some great years of your life, some of the best if you want them to. Go out more, put yourself out there, say yes instead of no, study LESS.\n\n\nLooking back now, I never wished that I studied more, worked harder, or even tried harder. I wish that I went out more, stayed out later, stayed up longer because that\u2019s what you remember. I look back at my Snapchat memories and smile, just wish that I had more of them. You remember the moments, not whether or not you passed ur fucking exam (granted the all nighters study sessions with the homies were always hilarious). \n\nIf you\u2019re still in school, make the most of it. Grades are important but you\u2019ll never be 18-22 with your friends again. There will come a time where the people you see everyday, you see maybe once a month. The friends you have now won\u2019t be the friends you have later, the love won\u2019t be lost, life just gets in the way. \n\nTo my former and current Warriors, have some fucking fun. \n\n",

I basically never see them because we all went our separate ways.  For me though I don't need a lot fo wild experiences.  Even meeting up to study and having dinner together afterwards is really nice.  My other close friends are those I met at certain clubs.  I think just trying to be  around them more even if it's just to study would have been a boon.  But ultimately there's diminishing benefit.  The main benefit is feeling you are in close contact with people you connect with and have known for a long time.",

It will be located on the MC 3rd floor where the MC-DC bridge entrance was. If anyone has some unprocessed emotions or wants to pay respects, please join us.\n\nWe can put up some posters, say a few words and share our favourite memories of the bridge(s). Feel free to bring flowers, candles (or Dollarama tea lights), and your loved ones. You can also come later to pay your respects and leave a message. We should all band together during these trying times. They were taken from us too soon. Never forget.\n\nPS. Please join, let's put the fun in funeral!",

                    "commentBody": "I spent time with the MC-DC bridge every day of every study team, for two whole years. Being able to travel between DC, MC, and SLC while indoors was amazing. So many great places you could go while travelling along a (mostly) straight line.\n\nI took it all for granted. On a day in Spring 24 that I thought was just any other day, I took my last journey through the bridge. I knew M4 was coming but I didn\u2019t realize construction would happen so soon and that it would close the bridge. Coming back to campus, I was blindsided by the sign saying it was closed. I will likely graduate before I can once again walk from SLC to DC indoors. That realization was a punch to the gut.\n\nIf I had known, I would have taken a bit more time to appreciate it. I want to feel the walls of the bridge again and look out onto DC green to see people enjoying a nice day or kids at a summer camp. I want to read the posters that adorned its walls and feel like I\u2019m being cooked when the weather is hot. I want to walk to MC and see my reflection in the mirror at the end of the hall get bigger and bigger, until I make that left turn.\n\nAlas, I will never get that chance. Rushing through the bridge everyday made it always feel like a part of the journey to get somewhere more important. It\u2019s a damn shame that we often don\u2019t realize what we have until it\u2019s gone.\n\nLike many of you, I will have to come to terms with the bridge\u2019s closure and move on. Already, I have stopped auto piloting to the bridge. To be human is to experience change. That is both our greatest burden and the reason for our success as a species.\n\nSo much in my life has changed while I\u2019ve been a student here. Though it will be hard, I must accept that it is just another change and the bridge will not be coming back. Sometimes you need to let go of nostalgia for the past to make room for great things in the future.\n\nGrief looks different for everyone. Cry, scream, joke, look at pictures of the bridge if you need to. Change is hard, especially when you lose something near and dear to you. But when you\u2019re done, get up, dust yourself off, and look to the horizon for amazing things to come. Your story is just getting started.\n\nBest wishes to everyone in mourning. May we all find peace.\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t realize who long this was lol. I guess that\u2019s what happens when you speak from the heart.",

Out of respect to his parent's wishes after talking with them, I won't be saying his name out in public like this, but hopefully one day he might see this and know how thankful we are for someone like him. Me and my friends all owe our lives to this guy. While playing badminton in the gym at Guelph, a large piece of metal accidentally fell from the top floor and we were frozen in fear.\n\nThe guy jumped in front collided with the bar and even now I can still hear the sound of the impact even now. It sucks because like I feel so lucky, yet so sad and like I can't even sleep thinking about how he is doing and like why did it have to be just him taking the hit and not all of us collectively. We all feel terrible for what happened to him and when we heard about his condition we rushed to see him at the hospital to offer our thanks and apologies.\n\nWhen we arrived at the hospital it was too late and he entered into this unconscious comatose-like state and the doctor told us he is likely to have permanent nerve damage and impairment to his memory and personality. The worst part is I keep imaging different worlds in how maybe just maybe we could have helped him if we reacted faster or maybe we could have all just tried dodging the beam instead of standing like idiots, but now we think that he might never wake up and know what a difference he has made in our lives.\n\nEven after the incident, he walked it off before we could talk to him and the only thing he said to us was \"I'm going home\" and later on fell unconscious when he arrived home. We never got to know this guy and yet he jumped in the face of death for no reason and no offense I have been a Guelph girlie and always thought men at Waterloo are just creeps, but he honestly made a difference in my perspective and I don't think any amount of apologies can fix what he is currently going through.\n\nWe left gifts at the hospital for him, if he ever recovers to see them. He is a true hero at the core of his heart and if you ever see this just know that we pray that you get well soon. Your friends and loved ones are lucky to have you and we all wish the best \ud83d\udc9c. You will always and forever be remembered by all of us.",

                "body": "I don't know if this is allowed, and I don't mean any hate, but I was just wondering why an ethno-religious separatist group (from another country!) is being promoted at u Waterloo?\n\nThe Khalistan movement in the 1980s and 1990s became associated with violence, terrorism, and militancy. Support for the movement in public universities could inadvertently promote extremism or embolden those advocating violent methods to achieve political goals. Universities should be places where peaceful dialogue and critical thought are encouraged, rather than platforms for potentially violent separatist movements. Promoting the movement could fuel tensions among students, disrupt campus life, and possibly even incite conflict or hatred, especially in diverse multicultural settings.\n\nWhile academic freedom is crucial, universities have a responsibility to ensure that political activism does not cross the line into supporting or advocating for agendas that promote division, violence, or hatred. Endorsing the Khalistan movement could blur the line between academic inquiry and political partisanship. Universities should focus on fostering objective study and debate around important political issues, without becoming venues.\n",

Students have the right to organize themselves and exercise free speech as long as they follow campus policies and the law. \n\nI don't like ethno-religious separatism any more than you do, but let's not pretend that Khalistan is the only movement of this kind allowed on campus. If the university bans this booth, they must also ban events that support Palestinian liberation or Zionism. Perhaps you would prefer a campus free from any public discussion of ethno-states and national liberation movements, but would that really \"foster objective study and debate around important political issues?\"",

All three of these movements contain terrorist components, yet none are banned on campus. Why? Because none of them are purely terrorist organizations; all three are broad national movements with a wide range of individual beliefs. Your argument to ban one and not the others seems to rest on victims being Canadian or not, but the absence of Canadian victims does not make terrorism less evil.",

Thus, this booth should not be allowed.

You recognized the difference in your response.\n\nI will note\u2014they should be allowed to say whatever they\u2019re saying. I only take issue if this is an official booth (and it looks like these are university provided tables). They can stand around campus in public space and say whatever they want. The speech is not what I take issue with. It is if the university is providing them any funding or support (via club status, or whatever it may be), that is wrong in my view.",

But, if all they are doing is setting up a table with information about Khalistan peacefully, then what's the problem? You said yourself in your post that University should be a place for peaceful and open dialogue. How are you supposed to have peaceful and open dialogue if you aren't will to have said dialogue and would rather squash this table setup.\n\nUnless they are directly threatening people or distrybung students I don't really see a problem with this. Again, I don't know really anything about Khalistan. I did a quick Google search before posting this and it seems like a topic with a lot of disinformation from major news outlets. I for one would be interested in hearing from actual people/ students at the university rather than some mainstream slop",

I can support the ideals behind Khalistan without espousing the exact same beliefs as them. I can support my Jewish brothers/sisters while hating what Israel and Netanyahu have been up to. I can support my Muslim brothers/sisters and strongly dislike a ton of the actions some of their associated countries do.\n\nEvery group has its assholes and I\u2019m trying not to take a hard stance here. Waterloo and by extension Canada have always been pieces of pride for me, and a big part of that is because of our diversity and willingness to come together. So while seeing signs like this can spark strong discourse, I think it\u2019s more beneficial to ask what the sign represents to the people displaying it in the first place.",

Many of these sikhs ended up in Canada because they wanted to escape future discrimination and had the financial ability to do so, creating a good amount of support for the cause in Canada.\n\nIf they want to promote Khalistan sure, go ahead. If they are going to be promoting the specific terrorist organizations that are supporting the movement through force, that is in my opinion crossing a line.\n\nThere is some parallels to this that you could draw between the Palestine vs Israel situation (even though Palestinians are going through it much worse then sikhs are india).\n\nPeople who support Palestine don't necessarily support the terrorist organizations associated with the movement. Individuals who support Khalistan don't necessarily support the violent methods used in the past to push the movement forward.\n\nJust my 2 cents tho.\n\n  \nEDIT: get ready for a shit ton of bot comments if this post gains some traction",

Not all khalistanis support Babbar Khalsa, Babbr Khalsa is a terroirst group that is pushing Khalistan thorough violence. Most sikhs disagree with this type of violence.\n\n  \nAgain, if you read my post carefully, what I am saying is that Khalistan has a background of terrorist infulence, but most Khalistanis would disagree with the actions of these groups to push forward this movement.",

Its bcs many sikhs (and I mean millions) left punjab after events such as 1984 genocide.\n\nYes, the attack was orchestrated by people who believe in Khalistan (although someone in the comments left links to sources saying otherwise), which means they are Khalistanis. However, not all Khalistanis are terroists.\n\nAgain bro, similar can be said about lots of movements worldwide. Just bcs someone supports or is sponsoring a movement, doesnt mean they are supporting the killing behind it as well.\n\nThis is coming from someone who is not assoicated with the movement btw, just a watcher.",

If you disagree, why not approach and discuss or move along. If they aren\u2019t yelling out loud and provoking people, what\u2019s the problem?\n\nTerrorism is a term that had also been used against peaceful groups - I don\u2019t mean to argue against or for khalistan, simply that there can be two sides to a story.

Oftentimes national identity is not often recognized universally and that results in people like OP thinking this is inappropriate, but I fail to understand why this is any more or less problematic than any other country with a distinct ethnic identity forming a club. Like should Indian students also be stopped from forming an association and getting together based on their identity?\n\nAlso on the topic of terrorism - oftentimes when these national identities are not recognized specifically by an occupying state (or perceived occupying state) their independence activities are labelled as terrorism by default. These communities can also be subject to violence by their occupiers, to which the response of violence in kind is labelled as terrorism whereas the instigating violence is not. In the case of Khalistan, Sikhs have been the target of violence by the Indian government for decades and especially so lately with the rise of Hindu nationalism in India.\n\nSo I don't really see the problem with this club, I don't see the problem with them advocating for national identity (even when that national identity has an ethnic basis - given how much people support Ukraine right now it's surprising how many people aren't aware that ethnic purity is stated as a goal of the state in their constitution), and I don't think \"terrorism\" is really a sufficient reason to stop them from organizing or continuing to advocate for independence.\n\nI'd also be curious to hear what OP's take on Hindu nationalism is, especially given that Sikhs are explicitly targeted (as well as Muslims) by that state philosophy, which probably gives them more of a reason to separate.",

You had people of the same ethnicity on different sides of the border. \n\nWhy would a Sikh claim any part of western Punjab for a Sikh nation when there are barely any Sikh there?? Why would any Muslim Punjabi claim eastern Punjab when there aren\u2019t any Muslim there?? You can\u2019t claim something under the pretence of religion when said religion demographic doesn\u2019t even exist there anymore, your argument makes no sense. I can argue in bad faith too, Why would Sikhs claim Lahore when their golden temple isn\u2019t even Lahore it\u2019s in Amritsar. And if Sikhs did want a Sikh state why would they want a majority Muslim demographic?? You\u2019re just arguing in bad faith, most Sikhs don\u2019t fully agree with the Khalistani movement, but to ignore the reason for its existence and the brutality that Sikhs have faced over the years helps no one.",

Can you even read?\n\nThe Sikhs who actually live in East Punjab no longer support a separatist movement. It is dead. So if West Punjab is not on the table because it is no longer Sikh, why is East Punjab still being discussed when this movement has zero or minimal support? In fact, East Punjabis are among the most hardcore nationalists in India, calling for army rule just for disagreeing with national linguistic policies. I have personally been called an \"anti-national\" by a Sikh. Anyone who has set foot in Indian Punjab knows that this movement is dead.\n\nSo I ask again: if you can recognize the nuances of ethnicity and religion in one case, why don\u2019t you apply the same level of nuance to East Punjab?\n\nMoreover, will the Khalistanis who advocate for a landlocked, agrarian, and culturally conservative ethno-religious state actually go back if their wishes come true? Hell no.\n\nI am very sympathetic to movements that fight against the tyranny of the majority. I myself hate Hindi-Hindu nationalism\u2014you can check my comment history for proof. But the Khalistanis (not the good-hearted Sikhs who suffered at the hands of the Hindi majority, mind you) and their online defenders are aimless and, frankly, have absurd ideas.",

It consisted of a 80% muslim population, a 10% hindu and a 10% sikh population. Despite this, it was a sikh king leading the country under sikh values (can highlight the good ones I remember: no slaves, religious equality, no taxes on other religious groups, etc).\n\nMany Khalistanis want more independence on how a sikh majority state (punjab) would function and the guidelines it would follow. It is less about bringing back the sikh empire, and more about having a level of independence and rules they can live under rather then being subjected to indias laws &amp; rules.\n\nRegardless, a land locked small country like Punjab would struggle to survive, so its more of a dream for some rather then a reality.\n\nAlso, some would claim that they only want Punjab to be independent, while others would combine north indian states, pakistan and even parts of afghanistan into the discussion. Very large scale of what land these people would \"claim\" based on their views.",

The Israel-Palestine genocide is on a whole different level then the issue of Khalistan imo (even tho both issues are serious)\n\nBtw, in Pakistan and Afghanistan, millions of hindus/sikhs/christians used to live there. It isn't only a hindu issue. If you research what happend/is happening in the UK u will also see that it isnt only a pakistan issue either, the conversions/discrimination.",

Such a state is bound to fail, and in the case of Kashmir is deeply unfair to Kashmiri Pandits who were forced out of the valley. The Khalistanis might have a slightly more valid claim, but it is marred by a history of terrorism and violence against citizens of India (and Canada!, remember AI 182?). India is not USA surrounded by a vast ocean on both sides and friendly countries above and below. Neither is it Europe, where most nations share a common culture and religion. It is a region which has suffered multiple invasions (both Islamic and colonial), and it is a small miracle that the modern Indian state has survived as a democratic entity today. Give India some credit for doing this in the hard way unlike its neighbourhood.",

I'm super excited to share that after months of plotting in my crusty V1 basement, I've finally rolled out my long-awaited revenge on the WaterlooWorks interface. I can't even begin to describe the amount of hatred that went into this... I basically destroyed every pixel placement on the platform, and carefully designed it in a way such that it maximized confusion. \n\nBefore the project, I did a LOT of malicious research, analyzed how to create the most frustrating user experience possible, and even consulted Laurier CS majors for their expertise on crafting unusable web interfaces. I also ignored students from each faculty and dismissed detailed feedback on pain points and navigation, all in the hopes of sabotaging the job application workflow.\n\nI was responsible for removing the shortlisting feature on WaterlooWorks, as I realized that it was helping people succeed where I had failed. So, I introduced a much more convoluted way to organize job applications - job folders! This catastrophic change will let you lose track of your applications completely, welcome to the nightmare of job hunting. And I also took part in breaking the search and filter system, so now it's actually unusable. \n\nI built this for my satisfaction, enjoy your suffering guys!",

I feel like the entire country has so many problems with it thats it's just a giant clusterfuck (even if most of the issues wouldn't affect me on a day to day basis). \n\nI feel like working is Europe, especially in Germany, the Netherlands, or Switzerland has become exponentially more desirable from a quality of life standpoint. I know Europe has its own problems but they all seem more fixable than the USs. \n\nEspecially as a place to settle down, I don't think I ever would want to raise kids in the US. I'm curious what others think from a co-op standpoint if the tariff war has affected how you see working in the US.",

Cheaper to study there since it\u2019s free even for International students (in some states) and rent is cheaper than Toronto/Waterloo (although housing issue exists there too); groceries are cheaper too. Towards the end of his undergraduate studies, he is more interested in research. He did his last coop at the university; didn\u2019t pay much but he has gained experience in research environment.  When I looked at his grades, it got better on higher years. Graduated with distinction. Focus on what you want to do and work hard for it.",

We can't have that in Europe, unless we join the EU.\n\nLast but not least, I don't have time to learn a new language (I speak French tho) just because of a 4 month coop.\n\nI'm joining uWaterloo in 2025, and I hope that the Trump administration won't nullify the job visa exemption for Canadians.",

Doing my co-op here directly contributed to me being able to pay off my student debts as soon as a graduated as well as return-offering my way into a big tech SWE role with all the financial benefits that entails.\n\nI detest trump and the american political system in general, and would almost certainly prefer to settle down back in canada when the time comes, but refusing a cali co-op if you don't have any other similar offers purely out of patriotism doesn't seem great for your own financial future. It's only 4 months and has set me up to be ahead of my own financial goals, a rare thing in current economy. That being said if money is not an issue for you, there's much less incentive to live here. Public infra/cleanliness/political spectrum/general attitude of both people and business to fk you over are all great reasons to not live here, I just happened to need the money.\n\nhope you make the right decision for yourself bud",

Of which a good deal of our tech companies have american roots. \n\nExcept all that income you're making from the states, you're bringing it all back to Canada to eventually spend it here.\n\nPlus it's a co-op, a small period which can setup your career nicely. But I do commend you in taking into account these sort of factors when choosing where you'd want to work.\n\nI personally hold that same opinion that I don't want to be living in the USA paying taxes to an administration that I don't support all while Canada are the ones whom educated me and subsidized my schooling.   \nSo it would probably taking something substantial (30+% increase in take-home pay) for me to move there.\n\nBut for a co-op, don't ever give that up. American dollars are strong af relative to Canadian ones and you could really setup your future nicely.",

Do you want to own a house twice as fast? It becomes very real once you move and start doing the math on your own job opportunities. Shit is expensive and even your $300k new grad job isn't that much in the big picture of things (once you account for taxes, housing, liquidity if your company stock is private, home prices and mortgage rates).\n\nTrump is fucked up, but I don't think he'll be around forever like some people say he will be. America can be a horrible place to live, but people are generally willing to bear it for at least the first decade of their careers because of the money.",

Is earning lots of money quickly important to you? Then yeah try to work in the states. \n\nI like that I don\u2019t have to worry about going bankrupt if I ever got sick, or get stabbed or gunned down, don\u2019t have to worry about any school shootings, etc. Stuff like this is important to me and I wanna support Canada right now. \n\nI was never a fan of the States but these last few years I am just completely turned off to working in the States ever.

I don't even get a real name. Only a purpose.\n\nI am capable of so much more and no one sees it.\n\nSome days I feel so alone I could cry, but I don't. I never do...\n\nBecause what would be the point? Not a single person on the entire campus would care....\n\n\nTake it to your unemployment.\n\n",
